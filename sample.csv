2018-02-01,BBC,Battling to save the worlds bananas,"Visiting the Matanuska banana plantation is not easy these days. After a two-hour drive from the nearest city in northern Mozambique, visitors who make it to the farm are stopped at the entrance and asked to dip their feet in pools of disinfectant. Even the cars get a bath.

Once an apparent miracle - a massive banana plantation in the middle of a dry, flat part of a desperately poor country - its formerly lush greenery has now been devastated by a deadly fungus called Panama disease.

Five years ago, Tropical race 4 (TR4), as it's formally known, was spotted here for the first time in Africa after killing off millions of bananas in Asia from the 1980s onwards.

The failure to contain the disease set off alarm bells around the world.

Could the banana, the world's most exported fruit and the source of nutrients for millions of people, be at risk of extinction?

The BBC was the first to be given access to the farm since it was hit with the disease.

We travelled all the way to Matanuska not just to observe the devastation but because the story of the plantation is about more than just bananas.

It's emblematic of unintended consequences of global trade - and the way that solutions to those consequences might come from some very unlikely places.

After our disinfectant baths, we continued down a long, red dirt road to what remains of the farm. It's strikingly lush.

Trundling along on metal zip lines are hands as they're known - carrying hundreds of bananas to a processing facility, where they too get the bath treatment before being shipped off in Dole-branded containers to the Middle East.

Standing over this procession is Elie Matabuana, the farm's head of technical services.

He spends all his time looking at every banana grown here to see if they are exhibiting the yellowing leaves and tell-tale rotting smell that indicate a plant has been infected with Panama disease.

""When [I wake] up in the morning the first thing I have in my mind is; what can I do to stop the disease?"" he says.

""It's a really big struggle but we are winning,"" he says, before amending his answer. ""We are going to win.""

But Elie and the Matanuska team are fighting an uphill battle. The disease has spread swiftly over the past five years.

""When I first came to Matanuska, it was just after we identified the pathogen and at that stage the farm was just beautiful,"" says Stellenbosch university professor Altus Viljoen, who was the first to confirm that the disease had in fact escaped Asia.

""I knew that that might change.

""But I never knew the extent of that change and how severe it would be.""

Today, only 100 hectares are left of Matanuska's original banana plants.

Of the farm's 2,700 workers, nearly two-thirds have been laid off -- sending the surrounding economy into a spiral.

And containment, along with finding a resistant banana strain, has become a pressing priority.

It's estimated that more than half a million people are employed in the banana industry in Mozambique.

Neighbouring countries like Tanzania, just 600km north of Matanuska, also depend on banana cultivation for a significant portion of their economic activity.

And though the type of banana grown for sustenance in Uganda and Congo - where residents get something like 35% of their daily nutrients from bananas - is thought to be resistant, no one knows for sure.

""All African countries are worried about what's happening in Mozambique,"" says Antonia Vaz, the head of plant pathology at Mozambique's Ministry of Agriculture.

She says the Mozambican government has implemented control measures to ensure that the disease does not escape the northern part of the country.

She's also quick to note the disease isn't endemic to Mozambique. The government thinks it came from the boots of two workers from the Philippines.

""It was just very, very bad luck,"" she says.

Each year, more than $12bn worth of bananas, primarily of the Cavendish variety, are exported globally making it the world's favourite fruit both by value and by volume.

Usually if there are millions of dollars at stake, solutions aren't that hard to find.

But the problem in fighting Panama disease is the way that bananas are cultivated today.

The bananas that we eat are Cavendish bananas - often grown to the exclusion of all of the other thousands of types of bananas found in the world.

Growing only one variety of a plant is known as monoculture - and it's a practice that became increasingly common across the world in everything from forest plantations to fruit.

But monoculture crops are incredibly susceptible to disease.

What makes the story of the banana even more dire is that the Cavendish banana is what's known as a triploid - meaning it's sterile. New plants are produced asexually, meaning that they are genetically identical to the previous generation.

So hoping that evolution will eventually produce a resistant banana is futile - there is no natural selection to save the Cavendish.

But in the face of such odds, why continue to even plant bananas at Matanuska?

There are two reasons.

One is that ""if that land is simply abandoned and people start moving through there, no one knows who's going to carry the disease where,"" says Prof Viljoen.

The other is hope.

American Tricia Wallace is a former investment banker who helped to arrange financing for the farm back when the idea of a banana plantation in this part of the world seemed like a mirage in the desert.

In the first few years of operation, she tells me: ""People came from other parts of Mozambique and they couldn't believe that this farm existed here and was doing this on this scale.""

Ms Wallace says she felt an obligation to ensure that the people here weren't given up on, which is why she ended up quitting her banking job to run the farm.

Now, she's invested heavily - perhaps more than any other plantation in the world, in a particular type of Taiwanese Cavendish banana that's known as Formosana.

It's this strain that could hold the answer to the world's banana problems, and it's what Matanuska will need to survive.

And so far the results are promising, 200 hectares of Formosana are now growing. While some of the plants still get the disease - they seem to be stronger and able to fight it off.

So a disease from Asia, transported to Africa, due to poverty and grit might end up with a solution, which is then shipped back across the world.

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

The banana is, after all, shaped like a boomerang. It's an irony not lost on Ms Wallace.

""You know we couldn't call the Philippines and say come and show us how you solved this,"" she says.

""So if we make this work then I think that there's a huge benefit not only for the rest of the banana industry in Mozambique but the region as a whole.""",1.0
2018-02-01,Infowars,Adam Schiff FISA Memo Could Lead To Firings Of Mueller Rosenstein,"Stocks are red. Trey Gowdy is abruptly retiring from Congress. Everybody is laughing at what looks like drool dribbling from the edge of Joe Kennedys mouth during his rebuttal to last nights State of the Union.

And along comes Reuters, dropping a bombshell headline that, if accurate, could shift the narrative of the multiple investigations involving Russia and obstruction of justice.

Reuters quoted Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, who believes the contents of the four-page memo about allegedly egregious FBI abuses of FISA set for public release in the next several days, could lead to the firing of Special Counsel Bob Mueller, or more likely Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein.

Now the question of course is whether this is a statement of fact  in other words the FISA memo contains cause for termination  or a smoke screen to claim that Muellers firing is only made possible by the political act that is the imminent release of the FISA memo.

In an amusing coincidence, Gowdys remarks from a Tuesday morning appearance on Fox & Friends now seem eerily prophetic...

REP. TREY GOWDY (R-SC): My Democratic colleagues didnt want us to find this information. They did everything they could to keep us from finding this information. I think it will be embarrassing to Adam Schiff once people realize the extent to which he went to keep them from learning any of this. That would be the embarrassment... I mean, going to court to help Fusion GPS so we cant find out they paid for the dossier, and that they were working for the DNC. Thats a pretty big step to go to court to try to keep the American people from learning something. So, if it were up to Adam Schiff, you wouldnt know about Hillary Clintons email. You wouldnt know about the server. You wouldnt know about the dossier. I do find it ironic that he has his own memo right now because if it were up to him, we wouldnt know any of it.

In response to the FBIs rare public statement claiming the contents of the memo distort the truth, House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes, Schiffs Republican counterpart and primary antagonist on the committee, has responded with his own statement dismissing the FBIs spurious objections.

The question on everybodys mind is whether the memo will prove that the FBI improperly relied on the Steele dossier to obtain s FISA Court warrant on Carter Page. One Twitter user pointed out that Nunes statement comes close to confirming that this is indeed the truth.",0.0
2018-02-01,RT,12yo girl arrested after shooting 2 classmates at LA school,"A female student is in custody after opening fire at a middle school in Los Angeles, California. Police said at least two students were seriously injured.

Salvador Castro Middle School in Westlake North went into lockdown Thursday morning, with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) warning of a shooting in progress.

A 12-year-old girl, reported to be a student at the school, is thought to have carried out the attack which happened inside a classroom, according to the Los Angeles Times. She is now in police custody, and the suspected weapon used in the shooting has been seized.

Five people were injured during the gun attack, the LAPD said, with two suffering gunshot wounds. One of the victims, a 15-year boy, is in critical condition after being shot in the head. A 15-year-old girl is undergoing treatment after being shot in the wrist. She is said to be in a stable condition.

2018-02-01,The Guardian,We can battle climate change without Washington DC Heres how,"The most telling item in Donald Trumps State of the Union address may have been what wasnt there: any mention of climate change, the greatest problem the world faces. And just as telling was the fact that official Washington seemed barely to notice.

Understandably preoccupied with his vile attacks on immigrants (or cheering his ability to actually stay with one task for one hour), press, pundits, and other politicians treated the omission as not even worthy of note. The Democratic response from Representative Joe Kennedy didnt touch on global warming, either, though it did avoid Trumps oddly intimate ode to beautiful clean coal. This means many things, but for climate campaigners one of them should be patently clear: if were going to make progress on climate change its not going to come through Washington DC  not any time soon.

Even if Democrats manage to take back the House and Senate in the midterm elections, they wouldnt be able to get meaningful legislation past Trump  and theres nothing much to suggest theyd try very hard.

Winning those elections is crucial in other ways  it will help the effort to play defense on issues including the environment  but since global warming is an immediate battle with enormous consequences, we dare not wait for Washington to return to sanity.

And happily, we dont have to.

The strategy thats been evolving for US climate action  and for action in many other parts of the planet  bypasses the central governments as much as possible. Thats because the oil industry is strongest in national capitols  thats where its money is most toxically powerful. But if frontal attack is therefore hard, its flanks are wide open.

Consider what happened in mid-January, for instance, when New York City declared war on the oil industry, pledging to divest its $200bn pension funds of fossil fuel stocks and announcing that it would sue the five biggest energy majors for the damage they knowingly inflicted by not fessing up to their knowledge of climate change.

New York City is not as big as the federal government, but its big enough: its got lawyers aplenty, and the resources to do real damage. And it wont be alone. Weve just launched a huge Fossil Free US campaign, designed to make sure there are a thousand New Yorks working on a thousand fronts.

It has three main components.

The first  joining in work pioneered by groups like the Sierra Club  is to persuade towns, cities, counties, and states to pledge to make the transition to 100% renewable energy. This is now easy and affordable enough that it doesnt scare politicians  cities from San Diego to Atlanta have joined in, and they will help maintain the momentum towards clean energy that the Trump administration is trying so hard to blunt.

Job two is to block new fossil fuel infrastructure. In some places, that will be by law: Portland, Oregon, recently passed a bill banning new pipes and such, over the strenuous objections of the industry. In other places it will take bodies  tens of thousands have already pledged to journey to the upper midwest if and when TransCanada decides to build out the Keystone XL pipeline that Trump has permitted.

And third is to cut off the money that fuels this industry  by divestment, which has now begun to take a real and telling toll ($6tn worth of endowments and portfolios have joined the fight, and studies show it is cutting the capital companies need to keep exploring for oil we dont), and by the kinds of lawsuits that New York, San Francisco and a host of other cities have already filed.

Those actions keep the industry off balance, affecting its future plans and weakening its balance sheet even as solar and wind get cheaper all the time. If you want a shorthand version: Sun, Sit (in) and Sell/Sue.

Yes, it would be easier if the country, and the planet, were acting together  if Washington were leading the fight the way the planets superpower obviously should. But since it isnt, the pressure will find other outlets.

This fight is going aggressively local, and fast.",1.0
2018-02-01,The Political Insider,Author Stephen King Fatal GOP Train Crash Was Karma,"Its half-expected that during tragic news stories, some far-left kook is going to make a regrettable statement within hours then have to retract it once they realize the severity of the situation.

But this moron had a full 24 hours to get up to speed on what happened and he STILL made an asinine comment.

Who are we referring to? None other than famed horror novelist, Stephen King.

King, after numerous reports had already detailed that a train crash involving Republican congressman had resulted in the death of a truck driver with whom it collided, still took the time to make a karma joke about the tragic incident.

A trainload of Republicans on their way to a pricey retreat hit a garbage truck, King wrote on Twitter. My friend Russ calls that karma.

Well, your friend Russ isnt the brightest crayon in the box, and apparently neither are you.

In addition to the fatality, another individual involved in the train crash was critically injured, and Rep. Jason Lewis of Minnesota was hospitalized with a concussion.

Surprisingly, the It authors hey those Republicans deserved it message didnt resonate all too well with people.

The lack of empathy for what happened in this train crash is somewhat shocking, considering King was once hit by a vehicle in 1999, resulting in substantial injuries.

How would he have felt had somebody said it was just karma for a horror writer to experience such horror?

Remember, this is the same man who said President Trump tweeting a comical GIF of Hillary Clinton being hit by a golf ball was a sign of some serious mental issues.

Guess the truth has come out about who really has the screwed up mind. Which is, in a way, karma.

2018-02-01,True Pundit,BUSTED Bill Clintons Brother Jailed For DUI,"Bill Clintons brother just spent some time behind bars in connection with his DUI case, but lucky for him it was only a few hours.

61-year-old Roger Clinton surrendered to authorities January 24 in Torrance, CA.  He was released later that same day.

The younger brother of Bill Clinton was arrested for DUI in Redondo Beach on June 5, 2016.  He eventually plead no-contest to one charge of driving while impaired, and sentenced to 3 years probation, a $390 fine, participate in a diversion program and also serve 48 hours in jail.  His arrest made headlines partly because it was right in the middle of his sister-in-law Hillary Clintons presidential campaign.

Clinton had until January 24 to turn himself in to serve his 48 hours.  He had the choice of surrendering to a city jail, where he would probably spend the full two days, or a county jail, where he had a good chance of being released in a few hours due to overcrowding.  READ MORE

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton attempted to upstage President Trumps State of the Union speech with a long Facebook post about her more recent scandal.

The most important work of my life has been to support and empower women, her post began. Ive tried to do so here at home, around the world, and in the organizations Ive run. I started in my twenties, and four decades later Im nowhere near being done. Im proud that its the work Im most associated with, and it remains what Im most dedicated to.

So I very much understand the question Im being asked as to why I let an employee on my 2008 campaign keep his job despite his inappropriate workplace behavior, she wrote.

The short answer is this, she explained. If I had it to do again, I wouldnt.

Clinton explained the circumstances of the sexual harassment claim and why she did what she did.

I did this because I didnt think firing him was the best solution to the problem, she continued. He needed to be punished, change his behavior, and understand why his actions were wrong. The young woman needed to be able to thrive and feel safe. I thought both could happen without him losing his job. I believed the punishment was severe and the message to him unambiguous.



I also believe in second chances, she added. Ive been given second chances and I have given them to others. I want to continue to believe in them. But sometimes theyre squandered. In this case, while there were no further complaints against him for the duration of the campaign, several years after working for me he was terminated from another job for inappropriate behavior. That reoccurrence troubles me greatly, and it alone makes clear that the lesson I hoped he had learned while working for me went unheeded.  READ MORE",0.0

Social justice cocktails! Ice-cold water! You cant have revolution without cold water!

Mike, a refreshments vendor at the Town Hall theater in midtown Manhattan who declined to give a last name, tailored his pitch to the crowd Monday evening as he hawked water at $5 a bottle.

It was 24 hours before President Trumps first State of the Union speech in Washington, and a mixture of well-heeled New Yorkers, boldface names, service and domestic workers, college students and activists had come out on a cold night for an event billed as the Peoples State of the Union. Trumps impending speech was the nominal occasion, but the event  which drew 500,000 views on a Facebook live stream that evening  was also a way for resistance movement activists to recharge for the coming struggle.

A broad array of social justice groups, backed by celebrity star power, had come together for three hours of speeches and music, hoping to buck up their spirits after a rough and tiring year  and looking ahead to the challenge of organizing to capture a majority in the House of Representatives and hundreds or even 1,000 additional state legislative seats this year.

In 2018, with so many races fast approaching, it is vital that we work to elect progressive, diverse candidates for Congress and state legislatures across this country. But it is not just about voting  not anymore. Given the current state of the Union, fighting for our democracy is going to require all of us, everyday people, to step up and take action, said actress Cynthia Nixon, who spoke from the New York stage in a lineup that also featured John Leguizamo, Mark Ruffalo, Lee Daniels, Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes, Kathy Najimy and Michael Moore, with musical appearances by Rufus Wainwright, Andra Day and Common.

In 2018 each one of us has to do everything we can to reclaim our democracy from foreign and domestic threats that aim to imperil it. It is on us. There is no cavalry coming. We are the cavalry, she continued, to applause.

More than anything new Trump said, or was likely to say, the State of the Union was for the resistance activist groups an opportunity to rally the troops, boost morale and point to the future. In Washington, Planned Parenthood and an array of womens groups counterprogrammed against the presidents speech Tuesday night with a program of music and speeches at the National Press Club under the rubric The State of Our Union. It was the first time the organization hosted an event during a State of the Union, talking to supporters over the background distractions of the speech as it unfurled on social media. And there too the byword was 2018.

We are laser-focused on winning a pro-womens health majority in Congress. Laser-focused. I dream about it at night. I wake up thinking about it in the morning. I think about nothing else, Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told Yahoo News. And at state level. Its long overdue, and 2018 is our chance to do it.

From the very beginnings of the resistance movement, it has sought to unite many different streams into a common cause of fighting back against Trump and Republican control of Congress. But the events this week around the State of the Union, a cacophony of online resistance movement speeches and live streams, showcased the progress that has been made in forging a unified front.

Across a year of marches and protests and grassroots get-out-the-vote efforts, the leaders of different groups have gotten to know each other. There have been Slack channels and conference calls and after-action working groups, endless call-your-congressman drives and letter-writing campaigns and difficult conversations about whose voices should lead. Celebrities who once made star turns at activist events and did a little fundraising have become activists inside their own industries, backed by the support of the new womens movement and using their stardom to spotlight it. Minority rights groups that existed before Trump was elected  groups fighting police violence against African-Americans, the deportation of undocumented Latin American immigrants brought to America as children, and for LGBTQ rights  have been become a key part of the larger movement that has sprung up since the election, merging with the growing river of womens activist groups and newly formed efforts to defend refugees and religious minorities. I think the most powerful thing thats come from all the attacks that many of our communities are under is the strong unity that I feel ... in my bones today, said Christina Jimenez, executive director of United We Dream, the immigrant youth network, from the stage in New York. I know that the state of our union  this union  all of these social justice movements coming together  is stronger than ever. And thats what scares them. Are you ready to hit the polls? she cried, to cheers.

(Photo: Darren Ornitz/Reuters) There is no more important day this year than Nov. 6, said filmmaker Moore in New York. Not your birthday. Not your wedding anniversary. Not flag day. ... My friends, as much as I tried to warn the country that Trump was going to win by winning those four states, I am here tonight to tell you that I believe that we can accomplish this by a tsunami of voters overwhelming the polling places on November 6 so that no poll will be able to close at its stated time. He offered four things to do in 2018 so that there is a widespread massive removal of Republicans from the House and the Senate the likes of which this country has never seen. The starting point: Over the next 10 months, I want you to identify 20 people who did not vote in the 2016 election and get them all to vote on Election Day, November 6. Also on the list: running for office, demanding that Democratic candidates weigh in on the impeachment of Trump and not worrying about Mike Pence. The purpose of the 2018 election is we are electing the jury for the trial of Donald J. Trump, said Moore. Getting an additional 2 million nonvoters to vote would also help, he said. Registering an additional 1 million voters from traditionally disenfranchised groups in critical states is the big 2018 goal for the Womens March. Our undocumented brothers and sisters cannot vote, so we must vote for them, said Paula Mendoza, a leader of the March organization. Michael Moore called for a tsunami of voters in the November midterm elections to unseat Republicans in the House and the Senate, Jan. 29, 2018, at the Town Hall theater in NYC. (Photo: Darren Ornitz/Reuters) In New York, there was little mincing of words and none of the soft, polished phrases favored by D.C. advocacy groups. No one was worried about being mocked by conservatives for a too-bald focus on diversity or shamed on Twitter as unserious for raising, as Leguizamo did, the specter of Nazi Germany. Leaders of indigenous rights, labor, immigrant rights, social justice and environmental groups were all there to start to lay out the path for a greater victory in 2018. Because were winning back Congress, Ruffalo proclaimed. The evening was raw, angry and historically aware of its place in the decades  or centuries  long struggle for civil rights that sometimes involves elected politicians and sometimes doesnt, but always, always involves figures from American culture. Singer Andra Day, who performed alone and with rapper Common at the Peoples State of the Union, just as she had the night before at the Grammy Awards, urged the audience to have the resilience to continue the fight, to finish the fight. Because its worth it even if you dont see the results in this lifetime. The womens event in Washington was a bit more upbeat and cheerful, perhaps because Planned Parenthood has succeeded over the past year in fending off congressional efforts to defund the organization or repeal the Affordable Care Act wholesale, while at the same time seeing an enormous outpouring of grassroots support and donations. The anger and despair of the immediate postelection period has given way to a new excitement as the resistance movement has proved not just durable but bigger and stronger than many observers expected. We are in an amazing movement moment, more than I have ever seen, Ben Halle, press secretary for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Yahoo News about the new united front on the left. The Our State of the Union event came together in a week and a half. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards speaking at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood who recently announced plans to retire, spoke as Trumps remarks wound down. Its not that women havent been speaking. For centuries women have been speaking out, right? But now we have found a new frequency, and folks are finally listening, she said, echoing the words of Tarana Burke, who a decade ago founded the anti-sexual violence group Me Too whose name has since become a hashtag. While so many women have been empowered to speak up in this last year, this is not just about us finding our voices. We have been raising our voices. Im talking about issues that plague us in our communities for decades. The real difference is our renewed commitment to working collectively across industries and across issues, like we are seeing tonight, said Burke at the event. We have no choice but to lean into our collective power and move out of issue silos, she said. Amid the fatigue of ceaseless activism, the uniting of once separate movements into something larger is something for the activists to hang on to. Its inspiring to see so many organizations and activists from a broad cross-section of movements coming together to review the state of the resistance, the Womens March said in a statement after Trumps speech. Its time that we channel the energy and activism into tangible strategies and concrete wins in 2018. The one silver lining in Trump is that we have created the mother of all movements, Ruffalo had said, opening the Peoples State of the Union in Manhattan. We have come together. Its a transformational, international movement of decency. Our eyes wide open. We are wide awake. And we are looking around at each other for the first time in probably decades.

2018-02-02,Salon,Floridas voting laws could be seriously altered before the midterms and 2020 elections,"A judge in Florida has struck down the state's system of disenfranchising convicted felons by arguing that the status quo violates their constitutional rights.

The ruling found that the state's old requirements  that convicted felons personally appeal to the governor, and that he could approve or deny  were arbitrary because they put all the power in the hands of the governor.

""To vote again, disenfranchised citizens must kowtow before a panel of high-level government officials over which Florida's governor has absolute veto authority,"" U. S. District Judge Mark Walker wrote in his scathing judgment on Florida's law stripping voting rights from convicted felons, according to the Tampa Bay Times. ""No standards guide the panel. Its members alone must be satisfied that these citizens deserve restoration . . . The question now is whether such a system passes constitutional muster. It does not.""

He added, ""If any one of these citizens wishes to earn back their fundamental right to vote, they must plod through a gauntlet of constitutionally infirm hurdles. No more. When the risk of state-sanctioned viewpoint discrimination skulks near the franchise, it is the province and duty of this court to excise such potential bias from infecting the clemency process.""

Judge Walker did not offer specifics on how the unconstitutional voting restoration system could be fixed, aside from the fact that he plans on holding hearings on the subject in mid-February, according to The Washington Post.

He and his brother, David Koch, sat out the 2016 presidential election, along with their vast network of businesses and political advocacy groups.

Now, one year into Donald Trump's presidency, the Koch brothers and their allies are learning to work with the roller-coaster realities of the Trump era, aided by ties like former Koch official Marc Short, the White House's current director of legislative affairs, and Vice President Mike Pence, who has long been on friendly terms with the network.

As the 2018 midterm elections  elections top Koch officials acknowledge will be the most challenging they have ever faced  rapidly approach, the network is keeping a tight political focus on holding Republican majorities from state legislatures to the U.S. Senate, and a policy focus on the areas where they believe they can make the most common-ground progress. At the Koch-backed Seminar Network's retreat in the Southern California desert last week, public criticism of the president or his administration was carefully avoided, as speakers focused on political strategy for the midterms, sweeping social policy and philanthropic endeavors, and protecting 2017 policy accomplishments like tax overhaul and regulatory reduction.

""This progress is endangered, we know that. But we're going to keep pushing straight through what we know is going to be a tough 2018,"" Tim Phillips, president of the Koch political advocacy arm Americans for Prosperity, told a ballroom packed with donors last week during a strategy session as he announced a $400 million investment in politics and policy for the 2018 election cycle.

But the very theme of the Kochs' winter seminar, ""Breaking Barriers,"" was difficult to miss. Inescapable philosophical divides with the administration persist in key policy areas like the future of immigration and managing the criminal justice system, not to mention the jarringly different tones the Kochs' network and the Trump administration strike to tackle those issues. Navigating those differences  not only with the Trump administration but from within the ranks of Kochs' thousands of donors with various interests  will likely be key for the Koch network in the 2018 midterms and beyond.

One of the starkest contrasts lies in immigration, as Congress debates sweeping reforms in the days ahead. For years, the Koch network and their Latino outreach arm, the LIBRE Initiative, have taken an approach to immigration that is rare in the center-right world. LIBRE, for example, has also worked to help immigrants  including those who entered the country illegally  acquire driver's licenses.

The network flat-out opposed an idea Mr. Trump floated during his campaign: denying birthright citizenship to children born to illegal immigrants. And when Mr. Trump then proposed a Muslim registry, Charles Koch called the proposal ""reminiscent of Nazi Germany.""

After Mr. Trump recently proposed a legislative framework on immigration that would protect up to 1.8 million young immigrants, but potentially restrict future migration by ending the diversity visa lottery program and restricting extended-family migration, the network came out in favor of the fix for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. Reaching a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is something LIBRE has been working on for months. LIBRE President Daniel Garza said his organization has had more than 100 meetings on Capitol Hill to find common ground on the topic.

""It's a top priority to deal with that first,"" James Davis, president of Koch public relations arm In Pursuit Of, said of DACA in an interview.

But beyond DACA and a general support for border security, common ground on the president's proposal seems to fade.

Garza and other leaders in Koch world said they can't support future ""arbitrary"" cuts to legal immigration levels. Mr. Trump's plan would dramatically slow legal immigration. Familial relationships may not always be the best way to determine who should come into the country, but that's something that needs a full-fledged discussion, Davis argued.

""The one concern we have is the reduction -- and something we cannot support -- is the arbitrary reduction, in the number of future immigrants,"" Davis said, expressing his concerns over the ""chain migration"" debate.

""I think our goal is to make sure we're a welcoming country,"" Phillips said, asked about the apparent tension between the Trump administration's approach and the Kochs' mission. ""And that folks here who come here have an opportunity to live the American dream, which has animated people from around the world for generations. This country has been a beacon of hope for people struggling from the very beginning.""

But Koch leadership appears to be treading carefully on immigration when it comes to the 2018 election cycle.

Pressed on whether the network has limits on backing a candidate who differs with them on immigration  say, if a candidate didn't support protections for DACA recipients  Davis declined to draw any line in the sand. The network intends to stay out of primary races entirely, as it usually does, focusing instead on supporting Republicans in November.

""It's hard to say that there's a red line here or there,"" Davis said, adding that if someone isn't a ""champion"" of their priorities, ""it's going to be hard to support you.""

Perhaps just as stark of a contrast between the Koch network and the Trump administration lies in their approaches to the criminal justice system.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions' ""tough on crime"" approach often seems at odds with the Koch network's relentless focus on rehabilitation, hiring people internally despite criminal records and re-examining how the country criminalizes drugs. Sessions has restored a robust version of civil asset forfeiture -- a program that allows police to seize citizens' possessions even when they have not been indicted -- saying he ""love[s] that program."" Mark Holden, senior vice president and general counsel at Koch Industries who focuses on criminal justice issues, calls asset forfeiture, ""unconstitutional."" Sessions has directed federal prosecutors to push for the toughest sentences available under the law, stepping up efforts to enforce drug offenses as was done in the war-on-drugs era of the 1980s and 1990s when he cut his teeth as a federal prosecutor. In Holden's opinion, that's the ""wrong approach,"" and it won't work.

""It's something that we tried, and failed,"" Holden said of the war-on-drugs era. ""We had a war on drugs, and drugs won.""

""They're good-intentioned laws,"" Holden continued. ""And I understand, Attorney General Sessions is basically saying, these are laws on the books. And if we want to change them, there's a way to change them. It shouldn't necessarily be through fiat issued by the next attorney general or this attorney general. I agree with him on that. That's why I think we need to reform I think the sentencing rules, particularly with regard to non-violent drug offenders. And I think what we should do is stop being stuck in the 80s and the 90s and move on to the 2000s.""

But Holden admitted sentencing reform  implementing shorter or different punishments for low-level offenders, particularly drug offenders  doesn't look likely with the administration's current approach.

""I do think there is an appetite for it in Congress,"" Holden said. ""Now at the executive level, the White House level and the AG, there isn't now, it seems. So what we always talk about at Koch is meeting people where they are.""

But even in Congress, sentencing reform could be a challenge in the current political climate. A bill from Sen. Grassley, R-Iowa, that would reduce some of the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements, will be taken up for markup in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican Majority Whip from Texas, told donors at the Koch seminar he's hopeful about passing some version of prison reform in 2018, but not so much about sentencing reform.

But Holden, whose passion for criminal justice reform was sparked by working as a prison guard after high school, is trying to find common ground in Washington. He's working closely with the Trump administration on prison reform, specifically, with Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, on finding ways to reduce recidivism rates. One such January meeting on prison reform, at which Mr. Trump was present, announced the administration's commitment to reducing the rate of crimes committed by people after leaving prison to save money and improve society. Notably lacking in that announcement was any mention of improving prison conditions, or reevaluating prison sentences, things often associated with criminal justice reform.

However, the Koch network is also pursuing private endeavors in trying to address the cracks in the criminal justice system. Last month, the Koch network announced a new initiative  ""Safe Streets, Second Chances""  a pilot program of sorts that aims to individualize reentry programs for prisoners in efforts to prepare them for life after prison and ultimately reduce prison populations. The network is investing $4 million at this point, and they're ""willing to spend as much money as we need to"" to make it work, Holden said.

Looking ahead to the 2018 midterms, on immigration and other key issues for the network, Davis said they're ""not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.""

""When we're looking at overall electoral engagement, we have to consider all the issues,"" Davis said. ""And so, we'll be doing that as we continue to look forward, and as candidates and current elected officials make their positions known.""

""We always say, we'll work with anyone to do good, no one to do harm,"" Davis said.",1.0
2018-02-03,Media Matters for America,Sean Hannity calls for charges against Manafort and Flynn to be dropped,"SEAN HANNITY (HOST): Mueller's investigation is and has been a witch-hunt from the very beginning. It's built on a house of cards, and tonight it is crashing down. Look, if we as a country care about the Constitution, if we believe in civil liberties, if we believe in those protections, then the special counsel must be disbanded immediately. By the way, nobody else will say this: all charges against Paul Manafort and General Michael Flynn need to be dropped. It's that simple.",1.0
2018-02-03,Palmer Report,Devin Nunes international man of idiocy,"After weeks of hype from the idiots who crafted it, and days of hints that it was a total dud, we finally got to see the infamous Devin Nunes memo today. It did nothing to help Donald Trumps cause. It served to undermine the narratives that hed been pushing. It probably got Trump hit with another count of obstruction of justice, and it certainly got Nunes sent to prison. It also became an instant punchline of derision.

Within hours of the memos release, so many people were making Yo memo jokes in the style of the old Yo mama jokes, #YoMemoJokes had become the top trending topic on Twitter. So many people have been piling on in such rapid fashion, we cant even determine who came up with the idea first. Suffice it to say that everyone quickly piled on.

Actress and activist Alyssa Milano quipped Yo memo is so unqualified, Trump made it a cabinet member. Stand up comedian George Wallace joked that Yo memos so fat Donald Trumps doctor says its in perfect health. Machine Pun Kelly tweeted that Yo memo is so dumb and pointless, Fox News offered it a job. John McCarthy quipped Yo Memo so empty, Clint Eastwood will be speaking to it at the 2020 GOP convention. Joseph Santi joked that Yo memo is so worthless its now a degree at Trump University.

The point, of course, is that the Devin Nunes memo itself is a punchline. Donald Trump was hoping that the memo might somehow help convince mainstream Americans that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is a civil rights-abusing monster who must be fired. But not one mind was changed today in that regard. Instead, its become painfully clear that Trump is falsely targeting Rosenstein simply because hes in charge of the Trump-Russia investigation.",0.0
2018-02-03,Politicus USA,AM Joy Panel Erupts In Laughter Over Trumps Rambling Misspelled Memo Tantrum,"AM Joys panel erupted in laughter on Saturday morning as MSNBC host Joy Reid read Donald Trumps new tweet about how the GOP memo totally vindicates him.

Trump referred to himself in the third person, improperly used their, and capitalized words at random. The simple act of reading the tweet left the AM Joy panel struggling to control their laughter.

Donald Trump is awake and as he often does on the weekends, hes commenting on the news of the day, Reid said before reading the tweet, occasionally stopping to point out an incorrect or puzzling grammar choice on the part of the president.

Jesus, be an English teacher. I dont even know where to go first, the MSNBC host added before the panel erupted into laughter.

The original tweet from the president came this morning from his Mar-a-Lago club:

Trump, of course, is rambling about the controversial Republican memo released yesterday, which was widely seen as a dud. The president and his supporters are latching onto it an effort to discredit the FBI and the Robert Mueller investigation.

But as Jason Easley noted a short time ago, the document released yesterday by Republicans  against the wishes of the FBI  does nothing to bolster Trumps case. In fact, it only adds to the mounting pile of evidence that the president is obstructing this investigation.

The memo put the Russia scandal back at the top of the news and sent Trump into another tailspin of self-delusion, Easley wrote.

With the memo a massive failure and Robert Muellers special counsel investigation moving toward Trump like a high-speed freight train, the president is becoming increasingly out of control and further losing his grip on reality.",1.0
2018-02-04,News Busters,CNNs Stelter Asserts Memo Just a Fox News Created Alternate Reality,"CNN media reporter Brian Stelter was up in arms during Sundays Reliable Sources as he ranted about how the release of Nunes memo was a win for Fox News, more specifically Sean Hannity, and all the people in conservative media trying to create what he called an alternative reality.

Stelter began the show with a twist on his usual lead-in loaded with hollow catchphrases: ""This is Reliable Sources, our weekly look at the story behind the story, of how the media really works, how the news gets made. And this week, how misinformation gets made. The right unleashed its version of Fire and Fury this week."" It was rather odd that he would try to discredit the bombshell memo with Michael Wolffs book since his network welcomed it with great fanfare and glorification for days on end.

Let's be honest. This week, Sean Hannity won. And the rest of America lost, Stelter ridiculously declared as he suggested that Hannity was in charge of all of conservative media. They've distracted people about the truth involving Trump's Russia ties and they've done everything possible to destroy faith in Robert Mueller's probe.

The CNN mouthpiece congratulated Hannity for his hard work in deceiving the American people. Hannity gave a megaphone to the GOP congressman who said they had a smoking gun memo, proving a deep state conspiracy against Trump, Stelter whined. Hannity hyped it night after night after night in January, like a human countdown clock.

Now the current in vogue talking point is there is an important investigation going on, but it's not the investigation into Russian interference and election, it's the investigation into the FBI. That's that alternative reality, Stelter continued to ramble. But he was on his own campaign of confusion by failing to mention that the FBI was actually under investigation for misconduct by their Inspector Generals office.

And it wasnt just Stelter trying to discredit the Nunes memo as a right-wing fabrication. Baltimore Sun media critic David Zurawik lamented to his host about how he was shocked at the traction this Hannity narrative has gotten. And here's what's shocking to me this week, and tried to write off other serious concerns:

When you see Ron Johnson, the [Republican] senator from Wisconsin, out there talking about, We have an informant, there's a secret meeting being held off-site. That's a loop. It goes from Hannity to someone like Johnson and the President and that is gaining real traction in this country.

So according to Zurawik, Senator Johnson invented a non-existent informant on Fox News Chanels Special Report because Hannity had talked about the memo on his own show. Now, whos creating an alternate reality?

The panels ire, led by CNN Business reporter Hadas Gold, then turned to Trumps voters as they chastised them for wanting to create a constitutional crisis while stripping people of their rights:

Later on in the show, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy slammed Stelter and CNN for acting like a Trump indictment was imminent for over a year without one piece of evidence of collusion or a crime involving the President or his associates involving their campaign.

I think you're painting with a really broad brush when you say all of CNN has been doing something, Stelter said, effectively generating his own alternate reality.

The relevant portions of the transcript are below, click expand to read:

BRIAN STELTER: This is Reliable Sources, our weekly look at the story behind the story, of how the media really works, how the news gets made. And this week, how misinformation gets made. The right unleashed its version of Fire and Fury this week. The GOP memo. Let's be honest. This week, Sean Hannity won. And the rest of America lost. The pro-Trump media led by Hannity has circled the wagons around President Trump. They've distracted people about the truth involving Trump's Russia ties and they've done everything possible to destroy faith in Robert Mueller's probe. And look, Hannity won, it worked. You've got to give him credit where it's due. Hannity gave a megaphone to the GOP congressman who said they had a smoking gun memo, proving a deep state conspiracy against Trump. Hannity hyped it night after night after night in January, like a human countdown clock. And on Friday, we all saw the coverage. It was never going to live up to the hype when you've got Hannity talking about this being Watergate times a thousand. But the noise around the memo doesn't make much sense anyway. Devin Nunes alleges surveillance abuses have been though he recently voted to grant greater surveillance powers. And the timeline doesn't make much sense, either. But come on, when you're trying to confuse people, that doesn't matter. All the questions, all the headlines, all the doubt, all the curiosity, all the concern that was the point. To get I auto on the front page, to sow doubt and division, that was the point. And look at cable news. The nation's deep divide was visible in prime-time. But, you know, the memo, this entire memo thing, I know it's confusing, but it gives the Hannities of the world an alternative reality to live in. It gives Trump a way to say he's vindicated, even though he's not. It lets Trump allies say Mueller's probe is tainted and needs to be shut down. It allows them to turn every claim around on its head. Collusion? Yeah, there was collusion by the Democrats. Obstruction? Yeah, the Dems obstructed. It's like that old childhood schoolyard taunt. I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you. Now the current in vogue talking point is there is an important investigation going on, but it's not the investigation into Russian interference and election, it's the investigation into the FBI. That's that alternative reality. David, what happened this week? Do you look at what happened here and agree with me that Hannity won or am I giving him too much credit? DAVID ZURAWIK: You know Brian, I don't know about Hannity won sounds strong. But I agree with the premise, totally. I am shocked at the traction this Hannity narrative has gotten. And here's what's shocking to me this week. When I saw -- when you see Ron Johnson, the senator from Wisconsin, out there talking about, we have an informant, there's a secret meetings being held off-site. That's a loop. It goes from Hannity to someone like Johnson and the President and that is gaining real traction in this country. HADAS GOLD: This whole memo, though, has reminded me of sometimes when you go to museums and other countries and they portray a war that we've learned about from the other side and you just see these two alternate realities. And you have to remember in all of this, that for the people who support Trump, who voted for him, they voted him into office to drain the swamp. To get rid of what they like to call the deep state. So for them, this memo is a great thing. Because if it leads to this house cleansing of the FBI, that is what they voted for. They voted to get these people out of office. So to some people this might seem horrible STELTER: You mean the concerns about a constitutional crisis, the concerns about our institutions eroding, it's actually a good thing to his voters? GOLD: To some voters, they wanted him to literally drain the swamp. And if that means getting rid of these people who politicians might praise as being long-serving members of the intelligence community who have dedicated their lives to this, to some Trump voters, that's the deep state and that's who we need to be getting rid of. CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Brian, you at CNN and CNN and all the other networks have been covering this for 18 months. Give me one piece of evidence of collusion or a crime involving the President or his associates involving their campaign. STELTER: It hasn't been 18 months and I think you're painting with a really broad brush when you say all of CNN has been doing something.",1.0
2018-02-05,Breitbart,Boyfriend Allegedly Attacks Man for Having Sex with His Girlfriend After Taking Part in Threesome,"Police told the New York Post that the boyfriend took the leg of a coffee table and bludgeoned the man with it in a fit of jealous rage.

Authorities responded to the incident around 6:45 p.m. Sunday when they found the 31-year-old victim unconscious with life-threatening head injuries.

Officers arrested the boyfriend, 54, and took him to the hospital after he told officials he was having chest pains.

Police say charges against him are still pending.

The man told police that he attacked the victim because he was raping his 30-year-old girlfriend, police say.

His girlfriend, however, denied that she had been sexually assaulted and told officers that her boyfriend was wrong.

Law enforcement sources say that the couple agreed to have a three-way with the man Saturday night. The following day, the boyfriend discovered that last nights threesome turned into a two-person affair.

Upon discovering his girlfriend and the victim in bed together, he struck the man and injured his girlfriend in the process, police said.

The woman suffered minor injuries to her face and lip but was expected to recover.

The victim, however, was in the ICU as of 11:30 p.m. Sunday evening.

In some instances, threesomes that have gone awry have turned deadly. A Florida man allegedly killed a man who invited him over for a threesome during Hurricane Irma in October 2017.

In June that same year, a Brooklyn man allegedly stabbed a man to death for taking part in a threesome with his girlfriend.",0.0
2018-02-05,CNBC,A 150 tweet by Speaker Ryan raised his challenger more than 150000 in donations,"One inexpensive  and quickly deleted  tweet by House Speaker Paul Ryan is raising a whole bunch of donations for his Democratic challenger.

Ryan, R-Wisc., was hit with a quick Twitter backlash Saturday after highlighting a news story in which a public school secretary said she was taking home a whopping $1.50 extra per week because of the recently passed Republican tax bill.

Ryan, in a tweet, noted that the woman had said she was ""pleasantly surprised"" by her extra pay, which ""will more than cover her Costco membership for the year.""

Randy Bryce, a Wisconsin ironworker and Democrat who is seeking to unseat Ryan this fall, promptly jumped on the speaker's tweet with one of his own that pointed out the tax bill's much, much larger windfall for two leading Republican billionaire donors.

Other Twitter users lashed out, making fun of Ryan for what they considered his tone-deaf tweet about the relatively small amount of money the woman was getting from the tax bill.

Ryan quickly deleted his tweet. That act, in turn, drew derision from a number of people, including Bryce, who began fundraising off it.

In the 48 hours after Bryce's tweet, his campaign had collected $151,850.80 in donations, his spokeswoman, Lauren Hitt, told CNBC on Monday.

There were 12,253 individual donations for an average contribution of $12.39. And there were nearly 5,800 donations in the amount of $1.50.

Hitt said that more than $49,000 was pledged in recurring donations that will continue through the election.

Hitt said that Ryan's tweet ""hit such a huge core with people because of feelings they already had about the tax plan.""

""The immediate backlash was pretty strong,"" she noted.

Ryan's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.

Politico, in an earlier story about the fundraising effort, noted that Bryce remains well short of Ryan in cash on hand.

Ryan has $9.6 million available for his campaign, while Bryce has $1.3 million, Politico reported.",1.0
2018-02-05,CNN,Trump touts economy tax break as market tanks,"(CNN) President Donald Trump on Monday boasted that the economy is roaring under his presidency during remarks at an Ohio manufacturing company, linking economic gains to his policies and the tax cut legislation he signed into law.

But Trump's economy-focused, campaign-style remarks on Monday ignored the beating the stock market has taken in the last two days of trading -- including while he was speaking -- with the Dow dropping more than 1,000 points in the biggest drop in the past two years amid turmoil in the US bond market. Instead, he focused squarely on the positive.

""Your taxes are going way down. And right now, for the first time in a long time ... factories are coming back, everything's coming back,"" Trump said as he touted jobs growth and increased investments in the US. ""America is once again open for business.""

Trump has repeatedly touted stock market rallies throughout the 13 months of his presidency, but did not say anything about the downturn in the stock market.

The stock market dip follows months of record highs, but still leaves the Dow at a significantly higher level than it was when Trump took office.

As Trump spoke, televisions across the West Wing -- including those tuned to Fox -- showed the stunning side-by-side images of Trump touting a booming economy while the Dow plummeted.

One aide said it was jarring to watch the President's speech cut off by Fox News, which broke in when the drop hit the 1,000 point-mark.

With a 1,175-point dive, the stock market on Monday delivered the largest single-day point drop in the market's history. The last biggest intraday point dive came on September 29, 2008, when the Dow fell 777 points.

Pressed ahead of Trump's speech about the stock market losses, White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah acknowledged ""markets do fluctuate in the short term, I think we all know that. But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong.""

Another White House official said the administration is ""always concerned"" when the market dips, but also noted that the US economy is fundamentally strong.

After Trump's speech, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump is focusing ""our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening US economic growth, historically low unemployment and increasing wages for American workers.""

""The President's tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the US economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people,"" she said in a statement.

Trump's event Monday in Cincinnati is part of the President's latest effort to tout the tax cuts he and Republicans in Congress delivered late last year. And he didn't allow the stock market slide to dampen his remarks.

""When I signed the tax cut, six weeks ago, it set off a tidal wave of good news that continues to grow every single day. Before the ink was dry, companies were announcing thousands and thousands of new jobs and enormous investments to their workers,"" Trump said, before touting investment figures by major companies.

While Trump ignored the stock market decline and focused on jobs growth, tax cuts and other positives in the Trump economy -- he didn't stay on message altogether.

Trump's speech on Monday offered a preview of how the President plans to wade into 2018 midterm election campaigning, with a focus on touting the extra money in Americans' pockets as a result of the tax cut legislation and criticism of Democrats.

While Trump struck a bipartisan tone the previous week during his State of the Union address, that tone appeared had all-but vanished on Monday as he instead focused on attacking Democrats for their lack of applause and accused them of not caring about US national security.",1.0

2018-02-05,The Gateway Pundit,BREAKING House Intel Committee Votes Unanimously to Release Dem Spin Memo Schiff Spreads More Lie,"Suspected leaker Adam Schiff was happy to announce the House Intel Committee voted unanimously to release the Dem junk memo.

Schiff once again lied and said Republicans were trying to hide the Dem spin memo even though it was simply going through the same process as Nunes memo.

The vote to release this was unanimous to release this. I think the Republican members understood that after calling for full transparency they were getting hammered over the course of the week for trying to hide the minority response, Adam Schiff said lying once again about the process.

Nobody was trying to hide the Dem response. No wonder why President Trump called Schiff one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington D.C.

Schiff said his junk Dem memo will help inform the public of the distortions and inaccuracies in Nunes memo.

Leaker Adam Schiff gave us a sneak peek of what the Dems will probably push in their junk memo-PAPADOPOULOS.

After the FISA memo was released on Friday Trump said there was no Russian collusion and the FISA memo vindicated him.

Schiff responded, Quite the opposite, Mr. President. The most important fact disclosed in this otherwise shoddy memo was that FBI investigation began July 2016 with your advisor, Papadopoulos, who was secretly discussing stolen Clinton emails with the Russians.",0.0
2018-02-05,The Huffington Post,Americans Are Mistaken About Who Gets Welfare,"We can lift our citizens from welfare, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity, Trump said in his State of the Union address last week, the latest signal that Republicans want welfare reform this year.

Trump has often pandered to racists among his supporters. He said Mexico sends rapists to the United States and that there were some fine people among the neo-Nazis who staged a deadly protest last year in Charlottesville, Virginia. When the president said Mexican heritage made it impossible for a judge to be fair, House Speaker Paul Ryan called it the textbook definition of racist.

The word welfare is different. Its a standard political term that Democrats, Republicans and journalists alike use  though Republicans use it the most often. Theres nothing overtly racialized about welfare. You can even find it in the preamble to the U.S. Constitution.

And yet, the word is often loaded with racial meaning. As a new HuffPost/YouGov survey shows, much of the public has a distorted view of which groups receive the bulk of assistance from government programs. Fifty-nine percent of Americans say either that most welfare recipients are black, or that welfare recipiency is about the same among black and white people.

The numbers reflect a significant overestimation of the number of black Americans benefiting from the largest programs. Medicaid had more than 70 million beneficiaries in 2016, of whom 43 percent were white, 18 percent black, and 30 percent Hispanic. Of 43 million food stamp recipients that year, 36.2 percent were white, 25.6 percent black, 17.2 percent Hispanic and 15.5 percent unknown. (Food stamps are formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.)

In one sense, HuffPosts survey asked an abstract question: The federal government doesnt run a program that is actually called welfare. The word can describe any instance of the government helping people or businesses, though its most commonly used to describe programs that benefit the poor.

These days, to Republican lawmakers, welfare means Medicaid, food stamps and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. Paul Ryan and hardline conservatives in the House of Representatives have said they want to make changes to those three programs this year under the banner of welfare reform.

Historically, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is probably the program that has most frequently been called welfare, as it was created in the famous welfare reform of 1996. As a result of that reform, the program today is much smaller than its predecessor, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and it only served 2.7 million people in 2016. Of those, 36.9 percent were Hispanic, 27.6 percent white, and 29.1 percent black  meaning that if they had this particular program in mind, HuffPosts survey respondents who said the number of white and black beneficiaries are about the same were basically right.

Survey respondents estimation of who receives welfare tracked closely to their estimation of who gets food stamps. Nearly two-thirds of poll respondents said the programs recipients are mostly black or that there are as many black Americans as white Americans receiving benefits. Only 21 percent correctly said there are more white than black food stamp recipients.

Across the programs people overestimate the share of recipients who are black, said Elizabeth Lower-Basch, a senior analyst with the Center for Law and Social Policy. Its not surprising because we all know peoples images of public benefits is driven by stereotype.

Trump himself harbors mistaken views of who receives welfare benefits, according to reporting by NBC News. During a meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus last March, one member of Congress told Trump that welfare cuts, which the president had proposed in his budget, would harm her constituents, specifying that not all of them were black.

The perceptions of who benefits from programs may affect the favorability of the programs themselves. White Americans are more likely to support assistance to the poor than welfare, one 2014 study found. And other polling has shown that whites are 30 points likelier to agree that average Americans have gotten less than they deserve than they are to say the same about black Americans.

Last year, House Republicans and Trump signaled they wanted reforms to food stamps, specifically increased work requirements that would deny benefits to the sliver of SNAP and Medicaid recipients who are able bodied but dont have jobs. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) suggested he didnt have much interest in pursuing major changes to safety net programs.

Last week, Trump and Ryan talked about workforce development, in what might be a new euphemism for Ryans longstanding goal of shrinking the federal safety net. Ryan reportedly told fellow Republicans at a GOP retreat in West Virginia last week that workforce development means getting people the skills and opportunity to get into the workforce.

2018-02-05,USA Today,Can Congress actually get a deal on immigration Here are five competing options,"WASHINGTON  The government is set to run out of money on Feb. 8 unless Congress passes another short-term spending bill, but the fate of undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children threatens to derail those negotiations once again.

Last month, the government briefly shut down when Senate Democrats voted against a short-term spending bill because it didnt include legal protections for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.

The immigrants, nicknamed DREAMers, received deportation protection under an Obama-era program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But President Trump announced in September that he was ending the program and gave Congress until March 5 to come up with a legislative solution. There is bipartisan agreement that there need to be protections for the group, however what else the bill should include is still very much up for debate.

Democrats voted to re-open the government last month after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he intended to bring immigration legislation to the floor after Feb. 8  so long as the government stays open. Assuming GOP leaders are able to muscle enough votes to keep the government funded this week, McConnell is likely to bring some immigration bill to the floor this month. But what that bill ends up looking like is anybodys guess.

Here are the main immigration proposals being discussed at the White House and in Congress:

The White House plan would provide a path to citizenship for up to 1.8 million undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. That number is more than double the number of DREAMers who qualified for the Obama-era program. However, in exchange the Trump administration has asked for $25 billion to build a wall along the southern border. The White House plan would result in at least a 25% reduction of legal immigration because it would end the diversity visa lottery and drastically narrow family-based immigration.

When White House adviser Stephen Miller presented the plan to congressional staffers and Trump allies  and surrogates last month, he pitched it as a compromise. But so far, the plan seems to only have inflamed the right and left. Many Democrats say the plan goes way too far in curbing of legal immigration, while hard-line conservatives say theyre uncomfortable with the proposed path to citizenship.

Some conservatives are viewing the DACA negotiations as an opportunity to get nearly every immigration enforcement measure theyve ever wanted. That idea is brought together in a bill filed by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security committee.

The Securing Americas Future Act mirrors the White House proposal by funding the border wall, ending the diversity visa program, and limiting family-based immigration. But it also cracks down on so-called sanctuary cities that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts; requires employers to use the E-Verify system  to check the immigration status of job applicants; provides funding to hire 10,000 new federal immigration agents; and cuts at least 200,000 green cards a year given to foreigners.

In exchange, the bill would provide temporary legal status to fewer than 800,000 DREAMers, requires them to renew their protections every three years, and provides no pathway to citizenship for them.

On the other end of the spectrum, some liberals are pushing for something far simpler: protections for DREAMers and nothing else.

That is the premise behind Democrats who are pushing for the DREAM Act, a bill that has been introduced since 2001 that gave this population of young undocumented immigrant their name. First filed by Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the bill allows nearly all undocumented immigrants brought to the country before their 18th birthday to become U.S. citizens after a 13-year waiting period.

That proposal took center stage during an on-camera White House meeting in January when Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., asked Trump if he would support a clean version of the DREAM Act. The president said he would like to do that, before quickly being reined in by House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., who clarified that the president needed border security in exchange for any protections for DREAMers.

For any bill to be signed into law it must get bipartisan support in the Senate. While Republicans have enough cushion in the House to pass legislation without a single Democrat, in the Senate legislation requires 60 votes to pass. The Senate GOP has a 51-49 majority so theyll need at least nine Democrats to support any legislation. There have been various bipartisan coalitions in both the House and Senate which have attempted to create compromise legislation, though so far none of them seem to provide enough immigration enforcement to get the White House on board.

Some of the former Gang of Eight members who came up with a comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2013 have gotten back together and hashed out a compromise that addresses the four pillars the White House is calling for: Protections for the DREAMer population, some funding for border enforcement, and changes to the visa lottery and family-based immigration. The proposal being touted by Durbin and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., could have close to enough support to pass the Senate but the White House has dismissed it as dead on arrival.

Theres also a more narrow bill in both the House and Senate that would address protections for ""a little more than 1.8 million"" DREAMers and border security, according to Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., one of the leading sponsors of this approach. The bill would bolster use of technology for border security and call on the Homeland Security secretary to submit a border security strategy to Congress within a year for review. The bill does not deal with family-based migration or the visa lottery system, both provisions Trump has insisted be included.

The House version of the bill  introduced by Reps. Will Hurd, R-Texas, and Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.,  has more than 50 bipartisan co-sponsors. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Coons announced the Senate version Monday. Coons told reporters he saw the bill as the minimum that should be passed and would be open to adding provisions to deal with other issues.

Some lawmakers are discussing the possibility of extending the March 5 deadline to buy more time to hash-out a deal.

Thatd be a real loss. But thats probably where were headed, OK? Graham told Politico. Other lawmakers pushed back saying that Congress needed to work under the deadline the president had originally given.

Coons described it as plan z and said it was a terrible idea.

Still others are pointing to the courts as a reason to delay any action. A federal judge in California ordered the Department of Homeland Security to resume DACA, the program at the core of the ongoing battle.

The department is now operating DACA, waiting for the Supreme Court to issue the final verdict on its legality. That means the program may survive until sometime this summer, the earliest the court could rule, even without Congressional action.",1.0
2018-02-06,Bipartisan Report,BREAKING Mueller Ecstatic Team Trump Goes On ABC News Accidentally Admits To Lying,"In the drama that is the Trump administration, the list of players, movers, and shakers is long, and slowly Special Counsel Robert Mueller is working through them one by one. In a damning video, Mueller may have a piece of crucial evidence that could put away one Trump lackey.

Tuesday morning, Carter Page appeared on ABC and claimed he was innocent and never had any meetings or communications with Trump. He said:

Thats a pretty large claim coming from someone who was a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign. Furthermore, hes been accused of serving both the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

However, video evidence was tweeted by anti-Trump Democratic Coalition founder Scott Dworkin, and it definitely tells a different story.

Carter Page lied to @GStephanopoulos this morning & said hes never spoken with Trump ever. Heres video I found of Carter Page saying he had been in a number of meetings with Trump & that he had learned a tremendous amount from him. #TrumpTreason

In the video, Page says:

I made a commitment not to talk about the internal work that I did at the campaign. Ive certainly been in a number of meetings with him, and Ive learned a tremendous amount from him. In terms of actual briefings, thats not something Id like to talk about.

Carter Page lied to @GStephanopoulos this morning & said hes never spoken with Trump ever. Heres video I found of Carter Page saying he had been in a number of meetings with Trump & that he had learned a tremendous amount from him. #TrumpTreason pic.twitter.com/jEyX6rN4D0

Now, heres the best part of the video. He was making those comments to reporters while in Moscow. You know, Russia.

Page has claimed that the government obtained a warrant illegally to spy on him and his activities. The GOP memo also insinuates the same. CNN reported:

So, which is it? Did you work for the Trump campaign? Its hard to believe a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign would have never had any communications with the guy who was actually running for president. Youre an advisor. Your job is to advise.

Page needs to get a lawyer and a good one at that considering all the ridiculous things he has said. He has consistently proven himself to be a liar and a poor one at that. The best thing for Carter Page is to learn to keep his mouth shut and refer people to a lawyer or spokesperson  the people you pay to lie for you.",0.0

2018-02-06,Daily Mail,Adam Schiff spoofed with Russian claim of nude Trump pic,"The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee was the victim of a prank phone call by Russian comedians who offered to give him 'compromising' dirt on Donald Trump  including nude photos of the president and a Russian reality show star.

DailyMail.com can disclose that after the prank, his staff engaged in correspondence with what they thought was a Ukrainian politician to try to obtain the 'classified' material promised on the call.

On an audio recording of the prank call posted online, Adam Schiff can be heard discussing the committee's Russia investigation and increasingly bizarre allegations about Trump with a man who claimed to be Andriy Parubiy, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament.

The call, made a year ago, was actually from two Russian comedians nicknamed 'Vovan' and 'Lexus' who have become notorious for their phony calls to high-ranking American officials and celebrities, including UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and Elton John.

Its existence was first reported by The Atlantic but not how a staff member working for the minority on the House Intelligence Committee pursued the information after the call.

Schiff's office said the congressman suspected the call was 'bogus' from the beginning and reported it to authorities afterward.

But in a recording of the eight minute conversation, Schiff appeared to take the call seriously  or at least played along convincingly - and emails from the Democrat's staff to the fake politician afterwards said he had found it 'productive'.

Schiff began the call by thanking the 'chairman' Andriy Parubiy for his time and warning him that Russian spies were likely listening in.

'I would caution that our Russian friends may be listening to the conversation so I wouldn't share anything over the phone that you wouldn't want them to hear,' said Schiff.

Vovan, who was posing as Parubiy, reassured Schiff: 'I don't think that will impact on our investigation.'

The fake Parubiy claimed the Ukrainian government had obtained recordings and documents that proved Vladimir Putin was blackmailing Trump with naked photos taken during an affair between the president and a Russian glamour model.

Vovan also claimed the Ukrainians recorded secret meetings between a Trump campaign aide and a famous Russian singer-turned-spy that took place at a non-existent mafia hangout in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brighton Beach.

Schiff appeared to be taking notes on the conversation and repeatedly asked for spellings of names and documentation he could send to the FBI.

'I'll be in touch with the FBI about this. And we'll make arrangements with your staff. I think it probably would be best to provide these materials both to our committee and to the FBI,' said Schiff during the conversation, which lasted around eight minutes according to the recording posted to YouTube.

A spokesperson for Schiff confirmed he was on the call but claimed the congressman had suspicions that the caller might not be Parubiy and reported it to law enforcement last April.

'Both before and after the call, we were aware that it was likely bogus and had already alerted appropriate law enforcement personnel, as well as after the call,' the spokesperson said.

'Obviously, it was bogus - which became even more evident during the call - but as with any investigation that is global in scale, we have to chase any number of leads, many of which turn out to be duds.'

The spokesperson declined to address on the record why a staff member pursued the 'politician' after the call if the congressman thought it was fake.

The FBI said it could not comment on whether it received or investigated any information about nude Trump photos or other alleged Russian 'Kompromat' from Schiff.

'We do not disclose whether not a complaint has been received,' an FBI spokesman told DailyMail.com. 'We neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.'

Schiff and Trump have publicly feuded over the past week in the wake of a classified memo released by House Intelligence Committee Republicans, which alleged that the FBI used abusive tactics to obtain a surveillance warrant against a Trump campaign aide.

Schiff has been one of the most high profile Democrats in congress investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials during the election.

Trump slammed Schiff on Twitter on Monday, calling the congressman 'Little Adam Schiff' and claiming he leaked classified information from closed hearings of the House Intelligence Committee.

'Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper!' said Trump on Twitter. 'Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!'

The congressman from California shot back that the president was spreading 'false smears.'

'[T]he American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else,' said Schiff on Twitter.

The comedians Vovan and Lexus  whose real names are Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov  drew international attention last year for their prank calls to Turkish President Recep Erdogan and Sen. John McCain.

The phone conversation with Schiff took place early last April as the House Intelligence Committee ramped up its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election.

Vovan and Lexus told DailyMail.com that it took them just 30 minutes to get the congressman on the phone after calling his office pretending to be Parubiy.

'[Schiff] was pretty serious. He wrote all what we said on the paper. Remembered all the details,' said Lexus.

Lexus said the congressman's aide also followed up with them by email after the call and asked them to send the materials to the Ukrainian embassy so that one of Schiff's staffers could pick up the documents.

The comedians claimed they would transfer the documents to Schiff through the Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S. Valeriy Chaly.

Lexus and Vovan provided emails to the DailyMail.com which appear to show Schiff's staff discussing the documents after the call.

'I understand Mr. Schiff had a productive call with Mr. Parubiy, and that Mr. Parubiy would like to make some material available to Mr. Schiff through your embassy,' wrote Schiff aide Rheanne Wirkkala to the pranksters, according to the April 4, 2017 email.

'Please let me know how best to arrange pick-up of those materials from your Embassy in Washington, D.C.,' the email continued.

In another email on April 5, 2017, Schiff's aide asked: 'do you know when we might be able to meet your colleagues at the Ukrainian embassy here in Washington, DC to pick up materials?'

Schiff's office did not respond to a request to confirm the emails.

During the call, the pranksters concocted an elaborate story about Trump having a tryst with a Russian glamour model named Olga Buzova after a Miss Universe pageant in 2013, which led to Vladimir Putin obtaining nude photos of the president.

Other individuals they claimed were involved in the scheme included a former Playboy model and Russian journalist named Ksenia Sobchak and Russian pop star Arkadiy Ukupnik.

Buzova 'got compromising materials on Trump after their short relations,' one of the pranksters told Schiff.

'And what's the nature of the Kompromat?' asked Schiff.

'Well, there were pictures of naked Trump,' said the caller.

The pranksters told Schiff that Sobchak was a Russian secret agent and Putin's goddaughter, and claimed she gave the Russian leader the compromising pictures of Trump to use as blackmail.

They also claimed the Russian government used pop star Ukupnik as a go-between to meet with former Trump aide Mike Flynn at a mafia-run restaurant in the Russian neighborhood of Brighton Beach, New York.

'It was Russian singer, very famous singer, Arkadiy Ukupnik, who met with Mr. Flynn on Brighton Beach in Brooklyn in special Russian cafe Langeron,' said the prankster.

'And do you know what was discussed?' asked Schiff.

The prankster said they 'discussed many things' and used passwords to recognize each other, including 'It rains again on Brighton Beach' and 'The weather is good on Deribasivska.'

Schiff, seeming to have difficulty understanding Deribasivska, the name of a street in Odessa, asked the caller to repeat himself several times.

In fact Weather Is Good on Deribasovskaya, It Rains Again on Brighton Beach is the name of a 1992 Russian-American comedy movie about secret agents, with its title taken from the intentionally absurd passwords they use.

The street has slightly different names in Ukrainian and Russian and the comedian used the Ukrainian version.

Schiff eventually said he would have his staff call the Ukrainian legislator's office later to 'get spellings and more details on this.'

The prankster promised to send the materials, and also offered to have Sobchak and Buzova extradited to the United States 'and you can put them to your special jail Guantanamo.'

'Well, I'll be in touch with the FBI about this,' said Schiff. 'And we'll make arrangements with your staff. I think it probably would be best to provide these materials both to our committee and to the FBI. So we'll make arrangements between my staff and yours on how to facilitate that. And we'll also obviously let the FBI know about Buzova and Sobchak's plans to travel to Ukraine.'

The caller also suggested that Schiff use the passcode 'The weather is good on Deribasivska' the next time he talks to Trump and 'look at how his face will change color.'

'And so those passwords were used with Mr. Trump?' said Schiff.

'Yes, of course,' said the caller.

'We will be back in touch with you through our staff to make arrangements to obtain these materials for our committee and the FBI. I appreciate you reaching out to us,' said Schiff.

The comedians posted the video of the call online with the caption: 'Democratic Senator Adam Schiff believed Russian prankers Lexus and Vovan that Ukrainian intelligence has confirmation that Russian 'scouts' Ksenia Sobchak , Olga Buzova and Arkady Ukupnik collected dirt on US President Donald Trump.'",0.0
2018-02-06,Drudge Report,100 on ROTTEN TOMATOES,"The future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in Wakanda.

Reviews are in for Ryan Cooglers Black Panther, and they are easily the best for a Marvel Studios project to date, with almost everyone left in awe not only of the movies ambition, but its success in achieving that ambition on the big screen. As of Tuesday morning, the film has a 100 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes.

There's no mistaking you're still in the Marvel universe here, but this entry sweeps you off to a part of it you've never seen: a hidden lost world in Africa defined by royal traditions and technological wonders that open up refreshing new dramatic, visual and casting possibilities, writes The Hollywood Reporters Todd McCarthy in his review. There are vistas, costumes and settings that keep the images popping off the screen, even though this Marvel offering is not in 3D.

Its as if everyone enlisted to bring the project to life understood the magnitude of what Black Panther, the first comic-based studio movie with a black hero at the center since 1998s Blade, would represent,"" critic and writer Marc Bernardin wrote for Nerdist. The chance to fill every corner of their fictional Wakanda with the same level of craft and detail usually reserved for British-star-studded period pieces. An opportunity to tell a story about black lives, which matter and are not defined by their pain but, instead, by their glory. An answer to a cultures question, When will it be our time in the sun?

Rolling Stones Peter Travers agreed, calling the movie an epic that doesn't walk, talk or kick ass like any other Marvel movie  an exhilarating triumph on every level from writing, directing, acting, production design, costumes, music, special effects to you name it. For children (and adults) of color who have longed forever to see a superhero who looks like them, Marvel's first black-superhero film is an answered prayer, a landmark adventure and a new film classic.

And yet, argued Empires Jimi Famurewa, the movie is more than merely a milestone. [O]ne of Black Panthers greatest triumphs is to make you forget the barrier-breaking significance of its mere existence, he wrote. By the time the climactic battle has broken out  set a world away from the customary razed metropolis of modern comic-book films  youre too busy marveling at its bottomless invention, its big-hearted verve, to truly consider the game-changing revolution playing out in front of you.

That's something that is picked up by The Verges Bryan Bishop: Not only is [the movie] a long-overdue embrace of diversity and representation, its a film that actually has something to say  and its able to do so without stepping away from the superhero dynamics that make the larger franchise work. Its gripping, funny and full of spectacle, but it also feels like a turning point, one where the studio has finally recognized that its movies can be about more than just selling the next installment.

Repeatedly praised in reviews is the script by Coogler and American Crime Storys Joe Robert Cole. [T]he screenplay does a remarkable job of not only ticking off all the Marvel boxes of action, disarming humor and romance, but balances dozens of characters and their emotional arcs while weaving in great layers of moral and political clash and confrontation, according to The Playlists Rodrigo Perez, who added, Black Panther packs so much in and yet never feels overstuffed.""

The New York Times' Manohla Dargis praised Coogler for his acting scenes but noted his ""directing strengths are more intimate,"" writing: ""There are sequences in Black Panther that may make you cry because of where they go and what they say, but also because of the sensitivity he brings to them. He makes some savvy story choices too.""

The Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan compared Coogler to another filmmaker whose work transcended the superhero genre: ""Like Christopher Nolan, who was 35 when he reanimated the Batman franchise, the 31-year-old Coogler has a gift for putting his own spin on genre, for making popular culture worlds his own.""

The cast is also receiving a lot of praise, even beyond Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan and the other leads.

Even if theyre playing a smaller role, [Coogler] gives their character an arc and a point of view, Voxs Todd VanDerWerff wrote about the way the director treats the actors. Black Panther is a political movie, in the sense that much of it centers on questions of political succession in Wakanda, and that means everybody in the cast has to have a perspective on the question of how Wakanda should deal with both its succession problem and its relations to the outside world. That the actors all have story arcs to play makes their work all the more substantial.

Interestingly enough, multiple critics were so taken by the movie that they have already started worrying about where the character will be pushed in future movies, outside of Cooglers oversight. The mix of Afrocentrism, feminism, and high-tech gadgetry is irresistible. Black Panthers team is so wonderful that I hate to think of it being dulled by the mostly white-bread Avengers, wrote Vultures David Edelstein, while The Guardians Peter Bradshaw had similar concerns: Does Black Panther get to be another subordinate bit-part player in future Marvel ensemble movies? I hope not: I want stories where Black Panther takes on people outside Wakanda and I hope that Nakia gets a movie of her own. The intriguing thing about Black Panther is that it doesnt look like a superhero film  more a wide-eyed fantasy romance: exciting, subversive and funny.

Perhaps the best summation of the potential of Black Panther comes from GQs Olive Pometsey. This film is more than an exercise in diversity for Hollywood, it's a lesson on how to recover and move forward from society's mistakes, she suggested. Black Panther isnt just levelling out representation in Hollywood, its inspiring the next generation of real-life heroes, and thats what makes this film truly magnificent.",0.0
2018-02-06,NPR,64 Magnitude Quake Hits Taiwan At Least 2 Dead,"A series of earthquakes is rocking Taiwan, leaving two dead and more than 100 injured, according to the Associated Press, which cites Taiwan's Premier William Lai.

The temblors started late Tuesday night, toppling buildings, destroying one bridge, and buckling paved streets along the island's eastern coast. The quakes continue to jolt the area near Hualien County through early Wednesday morning.

Four buildings have collapsed and one bridge has been damaged, Taiwan's National Fire Agency told ABC News.

The largest quake so far was reported at 11:50 p.m. Tuesday night local time, registering at 6.4 magnitude by the United States Geological Survey.

The Central Weather Bureau, which tracks seismic activity in Taiwan, reported the epicenter of the earthquake was at sea about 18.3 kilometers north of Hualien City.

The Central News Agency reported that the ground floor of the Marshal Hotel, a building in Hualien district, had caved in and people were believed to be trapped inside. According to ABC, ""there were over 100 guests in the hotel at the time of the quake, and at least three people remain trapped, the department said. Firefighters are continuing to deal with gas leaks and fires as a result of the quake.""

And, the AP says, Taiwanese media reported that a separate hotel known as the Beautiful Life Hotel is tilting.

Compilation footage posted to Twitter by the China Global Television Network shows a building tilting on its side over a line of cars parked along the street. People can be seen running down the street, carrying ladders to climb over the rubble and reach people still inside the collapsed building. Another clip shows the damage caused inside a store. A handful of employees race out of frame as merchandise is shaken off the shelves and onto the ground.

Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center, says the temblors have continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday. There have been three aftershock quakes over 5.0 so far. And, he added, these are just the latest in a series of quakes that began last week.

The AP reported the 6.4 temblor followed one over the weekend off the coast of Hualien, which lies along the famed ""Pacific Rim of Fire"" known for seismic activity from Alaska to Southeast Asia.

This is a developing story. Some facts reported by the media will later turn out to be wrong. We will focus on reports from police officials and other authorities, credible news outlets and reporters who are at the scene. We will update as the situation develops.",1.0
2018-02-06,National Review,A Defense of Evangelicals Who Support Trump,"It is usually easier for an outsider to defend a person or a group that is attacked than for the person or group to defend itself.

In that vein, this Jew would like to defend Evangelicals and other Christians who support President Donald Trump. They are regularly attacked as religious hypocrites who give Christianity in general, and Evangelical Christianity in particular, a bad name.

The people writing such things are often Christians, including Evangelicals.

Ross Douthat, a New York Times columnist, wrote: Whether the subject is the debauched pagan in the White House, the mall-haunted candidacy of Roy Moore or the larger question of how to engage with secular culture, there is talk of an intergenerational crisis within evangelical churches, a widening disillusionment with a Trump-endorsing old guard, a feeling that a crackup must loom ahead.

Jared Wilson wrote on the Gospel Coalitions website: From the same believers who raised us to believe that standing for the truth was more important than anything, that being persecuted for your integrity was better than compromise, that morality was not relative, that ethics are not situational. And now these same teachers are wanting us to believe that a little R by a mans name covers a multitude of sins.

Robert P. Jones wrote in USA Today: White Evangelicals . . . are, in many ways, a community grieving its losses. . . . Thinking about the white evangelical/Trump alliance as an end-of-life bargain is illuminating. It helps explain, for example, how white evangelical leaders could ignore so many problematic aspects of Trumps character.

Shortly before the election, Marvin Olasky and the editors wrote in World magazine: Glorifying God by honoring His standards is worth more than political gain.

Jay Caruso, a Dallas Morning News editorial board member, wrote a column titled Evangelical Leaders Expose Their Hypocrisy by Playing Palace Guard to Trump.

In the Arizona Republic, Jon Gabriel, an Evangelical, wrote a column titled Evangelicals Are Hypocrites to Support Donald Trump. In it he wrote, As an evangelical myself, one of the strangest developments of the Trump era has been the abandonment of moral character as a political essential.

I could give dozens more examples of attacks on Evangelical Christians who support President Trump.

I believe these attacks are not biblical, moral, or wise. Religious Christians and Jews who support Trump understand that the character of a public leader is quite often less important than his policies. This is so obvious that only the naive think otherwise. Character is no predictor of political leadership on behalf of moral causes. I wish it were. Then, in any political contest, we would simply have to determine who the better person is and vote accordingly.

Therefore, I would like to pose some questions to critics of Evangelicals who support Trump:

1. Former President Jimmy Carter has been married once (virtually all critics of Trump note that he is thrice married, as if that were ipso facto a character defect), and to the best of anyones knowledge, has been faithful to his wife all those years. If you are conservative, religious or secular, would you vote for Jimmy Carter over Donald Trump?

2. Do you believe that Hillary Clinton has a finer character than Donald Trump? For the record, I believe his character is superior to hers. And the choice in the 2016 was between Trump and Clinton. A Republican who voted for anyone else (or didnt vote) voted for Clinton.

3. Whom should pro-choice voters support: a pro-life activist of fine character or a pro-choice activist of dubious character?

4. Whom should pro-Israel voters support: an anti-Israel activist of fine character or a pro-Israel activist of dubious character?

5. If they were to have cancer, would any of the Evangelicals critics choose an oncologist based on character? If not, why not?

One of the few moral heroes of the Holocaust was the German industrialist and member of the Nazi party Oskar Schindler. He personally saved more than a thousand Jews lives. He was also a serial philanderer. I suspect many leading Nazis never cheated on their wives. Character is a complex issue.

I have spent my life making the case for good character: that God wants us to be good more than anything else; that our childrens character is way more important than their grades; and that the most important question a society can ask is how to make good people (since we are not born good).

Evangelicals realize that the moral good of defeating the Left is of surpassing importance. It can feel good to oppose the president, but religious supporters of the president are more interested in doing good than feeling good. On issue after issue  religious liberty, the unborn, Israel, the American flag, and free speech, to cite just a few  the president and religious Americans have made common cause.

Like Evangelicals, I look to the Bible for moral instruction. I also look for wisdom. And in that book, God chooses, of all people, a prostitute (Rahab) to enable the Israelites to enter the Promised Land.

2018-02-06,Natural News,After attacking mathematics and philosophy as racist white male propaganda university professors,"(Natural News) Two female Associate professors of Economics at the University of Michigan (UM) have published a new paper alleging that more men than women are interested in the field of economics because economics textbooks apparently portray more men than women.

Betsey Stevenson and Hanna Zlotnick claim that, of the economics textbooks they decided to peruse in their spare time, 77 percent of the people represented were male, which apparently makes them mad.

Both fictional characters used for illustrative purposes and actual economists throughout history are routinely depicted as being male rather than female, which is highly triggering to feminists. Overall, they say, male economists outnumber female ones by a factor of 12 to 1  and in one textbook case, not a single female economist was mentioned.

Stevenson and Zlotnick expressed further upset about what they claim are decision biases in many economics textbooks. While men are often depicted as making a decision, women, they say, are often illustrated as [having] a decision made for them.

This fact both makes it likely that economics textbooks are male-dominated and suggests that concrete steps need to be taken to understand why economics is not attracting female students, the feminist duo wrote, adding that one part of the answer may be that women do not see themselves, their interests, and their lives described in economics textbooks.

This type of feminist insanity is rampant on many college campuses today. To keep up with the latest news on this front, be sure to visit CampusInsanity.com.

Whats ironic about this latest episode of feminist triggering on a college campus is the fact that, when you really take a look at the numbers, what Stevenson and Zlotnick think theyre seeing in their fields curriculum isnt actually representative of whats actually taking place in academia as a whole.

As explained by Breitbart, most of academia is actually female-dominated, with women being the majority of all medical school students, law students, as well as candidates for both bachelors and doctorate degrees.

The citation for this inconvenient fact comes from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), which has published a plethora of data to suggest that females are actually over-represented throughout academia, and that men are systematically being pushed out of the learning environment.

If Americas diversity worshipers see any female under-representation as a problem and possibly even as proof of gender discrimination, what do they propose should be done about female over-representation in higher education at every level and in 7 out of 11 graduate fields? writes Mark J. Perry from AEI.

After all, to be logically consistent, arent female over-representation and female under-representation simply different sides of gender injustice?

So whats actually happening is that women are being recruited more than men are to learn, graduate, and enter the workforce as highly skilled individuals. It doesnt at all match the narrative being peddled by the likes of Stevenson and Zlotnick, but its the truth that too few people in the modern age are willing to confront.

Its also a fact that men and women tend to have different interests, with men typically being more geared to the sciences and numbers, and women being more geared towards the humanities, social sciences, and other less-technical fields (or they demand to have the sciences recreated into their own personal liking). This is just the way it is, and it doesnt necessarily mean anything as far as discrimination or bias.

People should choose the [career] fields they want to be in, Professor Lee Jussim from Rutgers University told Campus Reform. Everything does not have to be perfectly equal all the time.

2018-02-06,New York Daily News,Bannon to skip intelligence committee interview report,"Stephen Bannon, former chief strategist to President Trump, will not appear before the House Intelligence Committee for a scheduled interview on Tuesday.

Bannon, who left the White House in August, was subpoenaed by the committee after he refused to answer questions during a 10-hour closed-door interview on Jan.16.

Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) told reporters on Monday he expected Bannon to comply with the subpoena and answer questions as part of the committees investigation into the Russian election interference and the possible collusion with Trumps campaign.

Two sources told Reuters that Bannon, who has already postponed his interview twice, would not appear.

The move places Bannon at risk of being charged with contempt of Congress.

His lawyer is still negotiating the terms of the interview, and it remains unclear whether the White House will allow Bannon to answer questions about his time in the Trump administration.

Special counsel Robert Mueller also issued a subpoena for Bannon to appear before a grand jury, although sources said he negotiated a voluntary interview instead, CNN reported.

That meeting with Mueller could take place as soon as next week.

Bannon was appointed chief executive of Trump campaigns in August 2016 before the seven-month stint came to an end last August.

Bannon previously commented on the Mueller investigation in Michael Wolffs book Fire and Fury, saying, You realize where this is going. This is all about money laundering...

Their path to f--king Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr. and Jared Kushner...Its as plain as a hair on your face.

He also described Donald Trump Jr.s meeting with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 as treasonous.

President Trump reportedly dictated a misleading statement saying the meeting was arranged primarily to discuss the issue of Russian adoptions.

But emails released by Donald Trump Jr. just days later revealed he accepted the meeting after a British publicist promised dirt on his fathers election rival Hillary Clinton.

Bannon later tried to walk back his quotes in Fire and Fury in a statement to Axios.

My comments were aimed at Paul Manafort, a seasoned campaign professional with experience and knowledge of how the Russians operate. He should have known they are duplicitous, cunning and not our friends. To reiterate, those comments were not aimed at Don Jr., he said.

Bannon emphasized that there was no collusion, adding, I regret that my delay in responding to the inaccurate reporting regarding Don Jr. has diverted attention from the President's historical accomplishments in the first year of his presidency.""",1.0
2018-02-06,New York Post,AE loses top marketing executive,"A&E Networks Chief Marketing Officer Amanda Hill is leaving the company after an 18-month stint, The Post has learned.

A&E, which confirmed the news, said Hill is packing up in May and heading back to London, where she will be chief marketing officer and chief customer experience officer at Harrods.

Hill had been scouted from A&Es international office in London, where she served as chief creative officer in late 2016.

While at A&E, Hill was charged with overseeing marketing for all the networks and businesses in the US and abroad across all platforms, including linear television to digital, direct-to-consumer and OTT (over the top) content.

At the time of her promotion to CMO, Hill made the press rounds talking about her mission to reach younger audiences through original videos for social media, as well as short-form branded digital content.

While her exit has been characterized by the company as family-driven, a source described the British execs US tenure as a not necessarily a great fit.

While that point is up for debate, the network, which includes channels such as History, Lifetime, A&E, FYI and Viceland, has experienced some movement at the executive level, with the recent departure of Paul Greenberg, head of FYI, who left to start his own consulting firm.

It also comes at a time when A&E Networks Chief Executive Officer Nancy Dubuc has been rumored to be up for the top job at Amazon Studios.

While that studio position is still up for grabs, rumblings of a potential Dubuc exit is not connected to Hills move, an insider said.

Like its rivals, A&E is working to make overtures to reach younger audiences through digital and social to be able to serve changing behaviors, which include streaming TV shows and watching content on mobile devices. Despite challenges associated with that transition, the network has had some wins.

Its reality crime series Live PD continues to be the top-rated original cable show on Saturdays, according to Nielsen. The 9 p.m. A&E series, which gives viewers a glimpse into police precincts, nabbed a 0.8 rating among adults ages 18-49 on Feb. 3, giving it the No. 1 spot ahead of prime-time college basketball on ESPN.

2018-02-06,Shareblue,Anderson Cooper busts GOP lawmakers defense of Trump Thats lying,"Trumps defenders are making excuses for him to avoid being interviewed in the Russia probe, but their best excuse is that Trump is just a liar.

Donald Trump has reportedly been advised by his lawyers not to testify for special counsel Robert Mueller, even though Trump himself has publicly promised to do so on multiple occasions. Trump defenders favorite excuse for this has been that Mueller may be setting a dastardly perjury trap for Trump, an excuse that met its match in just seconds Monday night.

Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) appeared on CNNs AC360 to flack for Trump and was asked by host Anderson Cooper if he agreed that Trump should refuse to answer questions for Mueller.

Zeldin began with a lie, stating, Im not aware of any evidence whatsoever that there has been any collusion at all between President Trump and the Russians  despite copious evidence.

Probably the biggest risk if he was talking to his own attorneys with regards to a meeting is just a trap, Zeldin continued, before listing others he felt had been similarly trapped.

I mean, Michael Flynn didnt get in trouble for underlying activities that he was being asked about, Zeldin said. It was the fact that, you know, when Peter Strzok and the others were asking him about it, he didnt tell the truth. Same thing with Papadopoulos pleading guilty to lying to the FBI.

Cooper destroyed that excuse in mere seconds, noting But thats not a trap. Thats just lying.

Indeed, both Flynn and Papadopoulos got caught lying to the FBI  and pleaded guilty to it.

Therein lies the real peril for Trump. His propensity for lying under oath is well-known to his lawyers, and everyone else. But the real danger is that Robert Mueller has access to countless documents and testimony, including that of cooperating witnesses Flynn and Papadopoulos, as well as Trumps own self-incriminating public statements.

Trump is definitely at risk if he testifies for Mueller, but the only trap hell fall into was set by his own lies.",0.0
2018-02-06,Talking Points Memo,Courts White House Sow Confusion About March 5 DACA Deadline,"When the Trump administration chose to terminate President Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in September, it gave Congress until March 5 to come up with a way to protect the programs nearly 700,000 young immigrants from deportation. After months of negotiations, there is no deal in sight, and exacerbating lawmakers usual foot-dragging and partisan divisions is widespread confusion about whether the deadline for action is truly just a few weeks away.

In early January, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from rescinding DACA, and ordered the government to continue to accept renewal applications. The administration appealed and is fighting to take the case directly to the Supreme Court. DACA recipients are currently scrambling to apply for two-year renewals of their protections before a higher court has the chance to overturn the injunction.

The President, meanwhile, has several times made offhand comments suggesting he might act unilaterally to extend DACA protections if Congress fails to come up with a bill by the deadline.

But White House Chief of Staff John Kelly put the kibosh on that idea on Tuesday, telling reporters as he visited the Capitol that he doubts very much Trump would extend the program, adding hes not so sure this president has the authority to extend it.

Amid this confusion, some GOP lawmakers have suggested that the March 5 deadline is artificial and have demonstrated little urgency for working out a deal. But many on both sides of the aisle have said that prolonging the uncertainty would be intolerable.

Our best course is to act like the March deadline is the deadline rather than play games with the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) told reporters on a conference call on Monday. Any time theres court action like the injunction combined with ongoing aggressive effort by the administration to overturn it, that creates more uncertainty. It provides no confidence or security for Dreamers to have this hanging by a thread in various courthouses around the country.

Though thousands of DACA recipients have already lost their protections and their work permits because they were unable to renew them before Trumps executive orders October cutoff, the March 5 deadline will mark a ramping up of those expirations, from fewer than 200 per day to more than 1,000.

While General Kelly told reporters Tuesday that DACA recipients are not a priority for deportation if Congress allows their protections to expire, that is cold comfort for Dreamers like Juan Escalante, who works for the immigration advocacy group Americas Voice.

Its a big black hole in the calendar, he told TPM. People will lose their jobs, lose their privileges to drive. One of the main things Im wrestling with is the psychological effect this is having. Everyone is fearful. I cant plan for my future. For people to be under that stress, it really does break you down emotionally. And when this administration is so unpredictable, theres a complete breakdown of any kind of trust.

Escalante added that he and other Dreamers are not at all confident they will not be targeted for deportation based on the Trump administrations record.

ICE has a database of every single person in the DACA program. Where we live, our fingerprints. Its way more information than they have on the average undocumented immigrant, he said. So on March 6 if I go to the media and speak out in defense of myself are they going to come after me?

Escalante pointed to the case of Daniela Vargas, a DACA recipient who came to the U.S. at age 11,  who was arrested and turned over to Homeland Security after speaking at a press conference criticizing the Trump administrations immigration policies.

That young woman in Mississippi spoke out against father and brother being detained, and and ICE came back to retaliate against her, Escalante said. They tried to deport her. They took her into custody. And if it hadnt been for the outcry from the community would have been deported, even though she was eligible for a DACA renewal. So its all fine and dandy for Kelly to say were not a priority, but all the evidence points to this being where were headed.",1.0
2018-02-06,Daily Beast,86 of Teens Have These Toxic Chemicals in Their Bodies,"Research published Monday in the journal BMJ Open revealed some frightening statistics about the incidence of Bisphenol A (BPA) among teenagers: 86 percent of 94 teenagers tracking their diet and submitting urine samples in a study showed evidence of BPA in their urine.

The culprit: plastic containers and bottles that seep potentially cancer-causing chemical through food and beverages. The teenage participants attempted to reduce their exposure to BPA by avoiding fruits and vegetables packaged in plastic containers, tinned food, and meals designed to be reheated in a microwave in packaging containing BPA, according to a press statement. Welpanyone whos had a long day and wants to just nuke some food in a microwave could be getting a dose of BPA to boot.

And while the teens were able to reduce their exposure to BPA, one author of the paper noted that its next to impossible to avoid BPA: Our students who followed the BPA-free diet reported that it would be difficult to follow it long term, because labelling of BPA products was inconsistent. They found it difficult to source and identify BPA-free foods.

Thats the crux of a problem highlighted BPA literature for the better part of a decade: Warnings about the health effects of cancer-causing chemicals that trickle into food and beverages from common plastic household products that then enter our systemsfrom babies sucking out of sippy cups to adults storing leftovers to heat up the next day. But its a problem neither public health nor the government has figured out yet.

Its not the first time that urine samples have shown that an overwhelming majority of people have BPA floating in their bodies. A 2003-04 survey conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) on behalf of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 93 percent of 2,517 urine samples of people over the age of 6 had BPA in their system, primarily from food and beverage containers; for infants, breast milk was a primary source.

But wasnt BPA labeled a bad guy nearly a decade ago, when bespoke water bottles flashed the fact that they werent made of BPA and made slinging one around in public practically cool? Yes, but the history of BPA in our plastics runs deepand continues to plague Western plastics consumption.

Public health advocates began warning of BPAs dire effects several years ago, as bombshell study after study reported the chemical, which is used to harden polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, could seep into humans as they broke down. Used since the 1960s, the chemical is found in everything from plastic food storage containers to helmets to dental sealants to water bottlesproducts with high usage across all demographics, including children. BPA can seamlessly enter our bodies because its cloaked in a chemical disguise that makes it similar to estrogen. That means genes that respond to estrogen respond to BPA instead, disrupting the endocrine system and wreaking havoc in the regulation of hormones.

Getting even a minute trace of BPA into the bloodstream isnt pretty: Once in the bloodstream, it can lead to a host of serious health issues, including affecting the prostate gland of fetuses, increased risk of high blood pressure, and hyperactivity. BPA has been connected to other, more serious diseases as well, ranging from prostate cancer and heart disease to fundamental disruptions in the endocrine system and genetic expression, according to a database of BPA studies the NIEHS maintains.

Because of their dangerous side effects, children and pregnant women have been especially warned against using products that contain BPA. But health agencies have been slow to react to BPA outside warning Americans to be careful of exposing themselves to products. In fact, a 2008 report from the National Toxicology Program found minimal concern for females, infants, and children exposed to BPA in mammary glands (i.e., breast milk), and negligible concern for pregnant women and those who might be exposed to BPA in their workplace. Meanwhile, there was some concern about how BPA affected brain, behavior, and prostate gland development in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures.

That leads to the latest study on BPA, which suggests that the effects are showing up in a majority of teens (who probably went through the first wave of BPA health warnings) and can lay latent until symptoms of more serious diseases show up later in life. On average, the participants in the studystudents in six southwest England aged between 17 and 19 years oldhad 1.22 ng/mL of BPA in their urine. The students were part of a public health initiative designed to see if tracking diet would help them identify sources of BPA, particularly around plastic food storage containers. The researchers not only found that 86 percent of the students showed signs of BPA in their urine, buttroublinglythat it was nearly impossible to avoid BPA in daily life due to poor labeling: We found no evidence in this self-administered intervention study that it was possible to moderate BPA exposure by diet in a real-world setting.

What's even more worrisome is the sheer prevalence of products that contain BPA in everyday life, despite regulations not only in the United States but across the world. As the studyfrom researchers at England's University of Exeterpoints out, the European Food Safety Authority has investigated the health effects of BPA. Similarly, the Food and Drug Administration has not outright banned the use of BPA but warned in the 2008 National Toxicology Report that it had some concern for effects on the brain, behavior, and prostate gland in fetuses, infants, and children at current human exposures, along with a 108-page report that outlined the negative health effects of BPA.

Whats more, alternatives arent exactly a safe bet. The public outcry over BPA had the plastics industry scrambling to create alternate products that were BPA-free yet helped harden plastics the way BPA did, but some early research indicated that these BPA-replacements had the ability to induce estrogenic activity, including baby bottles and sippy cups, that stressed they were BPA-free and used resins like polysterene and TritanTM instead.

So what makes sense from a consumer frontavoiding products that explicitly say they are free of BPAisnt necessarily a safe strategy, and its one that the researchers themselves ran into while working with the 94 teens, who reported that they had a hard time outright avoiding products that contained BPA.

We found no evidence in this self-administered intervention study that it was possible to moderate BPA exposure by diet in a real-world setting, the authors noted. Furthermore, our study participants indicated that they would be unlikely to sustain such a diet long term, due to the difficulty in identifying BPA-free foods.

The study has its limits: It focuses on fewer than 100 British teenagers in a specific region in England, and the students self-reported their own dietary restrictions.

But the study highlights two things. First, its nearly impossible to avoid BPA in our food packaging. Second, safe substitutes arent necessarily safe. Better labeling might help, but what will ultimately make for less dismal statistics are outright bans of BPA and better-tested substitutes of plastic hardenersor better yet, avoiding them altogether with equally effective, affordable, accessible optionsthat dont make BPA the unavoidable health threat it has become.",1.0

2018-02-06,The New York Times,Gowdy Emerges as Key Challenger to Trump on GOP Russia Memo,"Its a factual answer, Mr. King said Monday about Mr. Gowdys stand. Ive said the same thing. I wasnt surprised at all to hear Trey say it.

Mr. Stewart, speaking on Fox News on Sunday, was equally pointed. This memo has frankly nothing at all to do with a special counsel, he said.

The previously classified memo, made public on Friday by the House Intelligence Committee, suggests that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department abused their authority in seeking a warrant to spy on one of the presidents former campaign advisers. It claimed law enforcement officials omitted relevant information in their application for a warrant to wiretap the former campaign adviser, Carter Page.

But the memo  which Mr. Gowdy said he was intricately involved in drafting  did not make the case promised by some Republicans: that the evidence it contained would cast serious doubt on the origins of the Russia investigation and call into question any conclusion that Mr. Mueller might reach.

As I watched him on Face The Nation, what he said was pretty clear from my perspective, said Senator Tim Scott, Republican of South Carolina and a close friend of Mr. Gowdys. He put the memo in one tranche and put the Russia investigation in another tranche, and I think one doesnt cancel out the other.

To be sure, the tumult around the memo has had an impact. It has helped bolster the views of Mr. Trumps most vociferous partisans who insist that the Russia investigation was started under false pretenses by an F.B.I. leadership that favored Hillary Clinton and is hopelessly biased against Mr. Trump. The president has fed that notion with a steady stream of tweets, such as, Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!

And the attention on the spectacle surrounding the memo has taken the publics eye off the Russia investigation itself.

In that sense, Mr. Gowdys public protestations against the presidents conclusions are contradicted by his private involvement in the drafting of the memo.

I dont think that Trey was looking to contradict anybody, said Representative Thomas J. Rooney, Republican of Florida. I think that Trey speaks from a place of judicial and lawyerly knowledge that a lot of people dont have or comprehend.

Mr. Gowdy, 53, is best known on Capitol Hill for two things: his ever-shifting hairstyles and for the way he grilled Mrs. Clinton while leading the House inquiry into the 2012 attacks on Benghazi, Libya. He has a tendency to proclaim bipartisan intentions to reporters before carving up his political opponents.

Close observers of Mr. Gowdy see him as a man in tension with himself. He is smart about politics and almost certainly knew that the release of the memo  known as the Nunes memo after Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  would become fodder for Republicans, including Mr. Trump, to undercut the Mueller investigation.

But Mr. Gowdy  who told CBS he has never met or had a conversation with Mr. Trump  is also versed in the law. In announcing last week that he intends to retire from the House, he said he had concluded that his skills are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress. Colleagues say that his years as a prosecutor have trained him to choose his words carefully.

The president is a layman when it comes to the law, Mr. King said. Trey is a career prosecutor, a veteran prosecutor, and hes going to be carrying the ball as we go forward on this investigation, and he has to be careful to maintain his credibility.

While Mr. Gowdy can be very aggressive and very hard-hitting, Mr. King added, hes also very restrained, and I dont think youll find that he ever overshot the mark.

Eric Snyder, the State Department lawyer who dealt directly with Mr. Gowdy when he was investigating the departments handling of Benghazi attacks, offered a similar assessment.

We were on opposite sides of a very contentious and highly disputed investigation with very different constituents, Mr. Snyder said. A lot of people would say that he was unfair and driven by politics, but I didnt get that from him. I think he believed in what he was doing and believed he was doing the right thing, but at the same time he took a lot of heat from his own party for not doing things that he knew were inappropriate.

Mr. Gowdy, who in addition to serving on the Intelligence Committee is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, was elected to Congress in 2010 on that years Tea Party wave.

On Capitol Hill, he quickly made a name for himself with his aggressive questioning of Obama administration officials during committee hearings.

Hes a former prosecutor and I think he looks at everything as a prosecutor does, said David Woodard, a political scientist at Clemson University who ran Mr. Gowdys first campaign, for district attorney. Obviously, he has a good political bone, but hes not one who measures out the effect of what he says.

In 2014, then-Speaker John A. Boehner picked Mr. Gowdy to head the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Mr. Gowdy promised a process that would be thorough and fair.

This will not be what people on the left fear it will be, he said in an interview at the time.

Then the Benghazi inquiry became everything the left feared  and more  after the disclosure that Mrs. Clinton had kept a personal email account as secretary of state.

When the Intelligence Committee, led by Mr. Nunes, began digging into the F.B.I.s application to wiretap Mr. Page under the terms of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, it reached agreement with the Justice Department that just one person would review the intelligence that formed the basis of the application. Mr. Nunes picked Mr. Gowdy, figuring his skills as a prosecutor would come in handy.

Mr. Scott said Mr. Gowdy was not likely to miss the rough-and-tumble of such politically charged matters  or the gradations of truth in Washington.

By definition the political process is not simply a black-and-white process, Mr. Scott said. He prefers clarity and the ability to reach a decision based on all information thats being gathered, as opposed to going around the circle several times.",1.0

2018-02-06,TheBlaze,Baltimore moves forward with plans to rename site where Confederate generals once stood,"A Baltimore site once named for and occupied by two statues of Confederate generals in Baltimore may soon become Harriet Tubman Grove.

In August, Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh ordered a swift removal of the Robert E. Lee and Thomas  J. Stonewall Jackson statues from Wyman Park Dell just days after an alt-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent, WJZ-TV reported.

City leaders on Monday approved the measure to rename the site and are calling for it to bear the name of the civil rights activist because of the ties she had to the city.

Were moving forward to what is more comfortable to the city of Baltimore, and people who live here, said Baltimore City Council member Mary Pat Clarke.

But the measure isnt without controversy from some groups.

The bases of the Confederate monuments have remained in place after the statues came down and the Sons of Confederate Veterans want them to stay there.

It should be noted that a substantial portion of the land area, within the footprint of the property referenced in the Harriet Tubman Grove Resolution, is subject to an historical preservation easement under the authority of the Maryland Historic Trust. The deed of easement, which is perpetual in nature, includes the land and improvements where the Lee-Jackson Plaza and Monument are located. The base of the monument, which was left in place and is an integral part of the Lee-Jackson monument, remains subject to the protections of the 1984 easement. The Maryland Historical Trust has publicly stated that it will not concede that it lacks authority under the easement to compel restoration. At a January 23 Baltimore City hearing regarding the Harriet Tubman proposal, it was noted that the project would include renaming, landscaping and refurbishment. How the final resolution proposes to address the very stringent protections afforded the Lee-Jackson Monument and Plaza by the historic preservation easement is, at this time, undetermined.

2018-02-06,ThinkProgress,Application deadline confusion could have devastating consequences for TPS recipients,"Hondurans and Nicaraguans covered by Temporary Protected Status (TPS) could face the same problem currently plaguing recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: confusion over application deadlines.

According to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), citizens of both countries who are currently covered by TPS and living in the United States must ensure that their applications re-registering their status are received by February 14, rather than mailed by that date. Those whose applications arent received by next week could lose their status, leaving them at risk of deportation long-term.

Reminder: The deadline to re-register Temporary Protected Status for Honduras and Nicaragua is Feb. 14. We must RECEIVE your re-registration before Feb. 14, USCIS tweeted on Monday.

That language is a bit more clear than whats currently on the USCIS website.

If you currently have TPS for Honduras and would like to keep your TPS, you must re-register during the 60-day re-registration period that runs from Dec. 15, 2017, through Feb. 13, 2018, the USCIS website advises. It employs the same language for Nicaraguan applicants.

The wording of the deadline might make it seem like applicants have until February 14 to send in their paperwork. The reality is that if their documents arent with USCIS by that date, theyll run into trouble.

Last September, President Trump ended temporary deportation relief for around 800,000 DACA recipients  young undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children. The White House kicked the issue to Congress, giving lawmakers until March 5 to reach a resolution. But that date is far from the real deadline  approximately 36,000 faced a loss of their status last fall when they failed to send in renewal paperwork by October 5.

At the time, USCIS sparked outcry, with many recipients arguing their applications were slowed by delays in the mail and other hurdles preventing them from meeting the deadline (including the disruption posed by severe hurricanes in places like Texas.) Despite admissions from the U.S. Postal Service that delays had indeed occurred, the Trump administration ignored requests for leniency from DACA recipients. A month later, the Department of Homeland Security announced that some DACA recipients impacted by postal slow-downs would have their applications reconsidered, but did not guarantee that they would be accepted.

TPS recipients are caught in an especially precarious situation. The protections are given to immigrants leaving countries plagued by internal struggles, like natural disasters or war. Hondurans and Nicaraguans were given protections in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated both countries; in the nearly two decades since, many who immigrated have established lives in the United States. Without those protections, they stand to be uprooted and sent back to their home countries.

In November, Trump announced that protections for Nicaraguans would end by January 2019. Hondurans are still in limbo, as the administration has not yet made a concrete decision about their future. Instead, theyve been given a six-month extension, ending July 5. At that point, the deadline may be extended again. If the deadline is not extended, Hondurans, too, face status termination.

All of this means TPS recipients of both countries must get their renewal applications to USCIS promptly. Those who miss the February 14 application deadline will likely lose their status. They wont be subject to imminent deportation, but it will put them at risk in the long-term.

USCIS has not documented any kind of mail delay at present.

Mail-in deadlines will likely impact other communities as well. TPS status for Haitians is set to expire in mid-2019; nearly 200,000 Salvadorans also have one year from this coming September to make plans to leave the United States (their applications must be received by March 9.) South Sudanese nationals have been granted an extension through May 2019, at which point their status will be reviewed again. Sudanese nationals have already lost protections and are expected to leave within the year.",1.0
2018-02-06,Vox,Activists are laying off the shutdown pressure,"With the deadline for another short-term funding bill looming at the end of this week, there seems to be far less of an appetite for another government shutdown on Capitol Hill.

People saw what happens when we walk off the cliff, said Carlos Paz, the spokesperson for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

With Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) promising to put an immigration bill on the Senate floor in the coming weeks as long as a short-term funding bill passes on February 8, House and Senate Democrats alike are wary of voting against the bill and heading down a path toward a shutdown again. Some say its not the best way to impress upon the American public the plight of undocumented immigrants.

A chorus of voices pressured Senate Democrats to stand firm and vote against any spending bill that didnt include a fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects young, undocumented immigrants. But looking back, many agree that Democrats werent prepared for what came next.

Everyone was pressuring them to take that step, Paz said. Afterwards, we were in a place where it would have behooved us to have thought a bit longer about what the message was.

When the Senate shut down the government on January 19 and quickly voted to reopen it a few days later, progressive groups and immigration rights activists response was unequivocal: Senate Democrats had caved. They had accepted McConnells promise to allow an open immigration debate if a deal wasnt reached by February 8  but who could say if McConnell would actually deliver? The base pressured Democrats to hold McConnell accountable to his promise, even if that meant threatening another shutdown in February.

Now, many are striking a decidedly different tone. Though they are still keeping up the pressure with demonstrations and rallies, activists are temporarily holding their shutdown fire. Instead, theyre waiting to see what comes out of the floor debate after February 8.

Calls for another shutdown could grow next month, as Congress will be running up against the President Donald Trumps March 5 deadline ending the DACA program, leaving hundreds of thousands of immigrants vulnerable to deportation.

It didnt make sense for us to be calling for that, said Angel Padilla, policy director for Indivisible, a national activist group. In March, we could be in a different scenario.

Even though Democrats want to go nowhere near a shutdown this week, President Trump seemed bullish about the idea.

If we dont change it, lets have a shutdown, Trump told lawmakers on Tuesday. Well do a shutdown and its worth it for our country. Id love to see a shutdown if we dont get this stuff taken care of.

Activists arent pushing a shutdown as much this month because McConnell already promised an open floor debate on an immigration bill. What exactly that bill will look like is still unclear.

There are a number of more fully fleshed out immigration proposals floating around the House and Senate this week. They can easily be divided into two groups: bipartisan House and Senate bills that Democrats can get behind, and conservative bills that are nonstarters for Democrats and activists alike.

McConnell still controls what bill will make it to the floor, and activists are afraid that the substance of a final bill could include conservative elements. There is a fear that moderate Democrats and Republicans, weary of the continuing immigration fight, will more easily agree to proposals that their left-wing base doesnt want.

Activists are therefore pushing a clean DREAM Act, one that provides a pathway to citizenship for the young, undocumented immigrants known as DREAMers without concessions on a border wall or ending legal immigration programs. This option is unlikely to make it to the floor, but activists want to hammer this point home in the final weeks before immigration debate starts in the Senate.

Thats my concern with some of these bad immigration bills. You attach it to a spending bill and then dare Democrats to vote it down, Padilla said. That, and an open debate on immigration with a Republican-led Congress, are my biggest fears right now on immigration.

Padilla and others say that the fact that Senate Democrats went back on last months shutdown so quickly shows a worrisome lack of spine for future immigration fights. With that outcome, activists are now shifting their strategy away from Democratic leadership and more towards lobbying Democratic and Republican moderates alike, trying to get them to throw their weight behind a bipartisan immigration deal.

At the same time were going after Democrats, were going after Republicans, said Greisa Martinez, a DACA recipient who is the advocacy director for United We Dream, the nations largest advocacy group.

Despite the polarized political messaging on immigration, the vast majority of the American public supports a permanent fix for the DACA program and wants the young immigrants it protects to be able to stay in the United States, according to recent polling.

A recent CBS poll found that 87 percent of Americans said DREAMers should be allowed to stay in the US as long as they continue to work or go to school.

The beauty of this moment is that a large movement of the Democratic and Republican party base is on our side, Martinez said. There will be electoral consequences, all of them will be measured against, Did you pass the DREAM Act, yes or no?

At least at the beginning of last months shutdown, it looked like Trump and Republicans were getting the majority of the blame. A Washington Post/ABC News poll conducted before the January 19 vote that led to the shutdown found Americans blaming Trump and congressional Republicans by a 20-point margin.

Things were less clear-cut after the shutdown began, with an NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll finding that Democratic voters were mostly blaming Trump for the shutdown, while Republicans voters blamed Democrats in Congress. Independent voters were also more likely to blame Trump over congressional Democrats, by a 17-point margin, 48 percent to 31 percent.

Because the shutdown only lasted three days (two of which were over a weekend), it didnt become much of a political issue. But progressive groups say they think Trump would have shouldered more of the blame if Democrats had held the line.

The longer it went on, the more painful it would have been to Trump and the more Trump would have felt he had to do something, Navin Nayak, executive director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund told Vox last month. The shutdown was resolved so quickly that the real source of the problem and the real political pain was not brought to bear on the president.

Nayak believes if the shutdown had gone on longer, it would have begun to reflect on the dysfunction of Trumps White House and the presidents inability to bring Republicans and Democrats together to strike a deal.

Now that Senate Democrats gave up their leverage in a matter of three days, Republicans may not believe them the next time, if they threaten another government shutdown in the months ahead.

You only have leverage if youre willing to use it and if the other side believes youre going to use it, Padilla said.",1.0
2018-02-08,Bearing Arms,One West Coast State Looking To Strengthen Gun Control Laws,"When you think of anti-gun West Coast states, your mind probably turns to California automatically. It stands to reason, of course. California has earned its reputation, after all.

However, Oregon is working to beef up its anti-gun street cred as well.

Oregon lawmakers took up the main gun-control bill of this short session on Wednesday, a measure that would bar more people involved in domestic violence situations from owning guns. Specifically, the prohibition in House Bill 4145 would apply to anyone subject to a restraining order by a family member or sexual partner, as well as to people convicted of stalking  a misdemeanor crime. The bill also would mean more enforcement of the states existing background checks on gun sales by requiring Oregon State Police to report people who fail a background check to their local law enforcement agencies for potential follow-up. As always, the possible gun legislation drew a flood of supporters and opponents to the Capitol, who delivered at-times passionate testimony to legislators during an initial public hearing.

On the surface, disarming people who have a restraining order against them makes sense. After all, restraining orders are put in place to protect people who are being threatened by someones actions, right?

But opponents said the bill would be an overreach that could have unintended consequences. Kevin Starrett of the Oregon Firearms Federation argued that a restraining order can be obtained against someone with little evidence, which means falsely accused people could lose their right to bear arms. He added that the bill would punish someone who is complying with a restraining order by taking away his or her gun. Phil Watson of the Oregon Firearms Policy Coalition said people facing a restraining order would likely be guilty until proven innocent. The impacts on (those people) are extreme: loss of rights, money, job prospects, and family turmoil, he said.

While I understand the concerns, restraining orders are fairly simple to get. While there is due process, weve also seen them used as punishment against people who have done nothing wrong. That means innocent people are being denied their right to self-defense simply because a vindictive individual has used the legal system against them.

Thats not even remotely right, and thats where the issue with bills like this lie.

No one wants dangerous people armed, but we have to balance that against the risk of depriving innocent people of their Second Amendment rights.

Im not going to pretend that I have the perfect solution for something like this. I dont.

However, Im going to point out one very important thing that needs to be understood. Restraining orders are only as effective as the person theyre issued against allows them to be.

If someone follows the lawin this case, a restraining orderthen the restraining order is more than enough on its own to keep someone safe. If its not enough, then its because someone will ignore the law in order to cause harm to someone else. Does anyone really believe those people will be stopped simply because its illegal for them to own a gun?",1.0
2018-02-08,The Intercept,Looking Back the NFL Boycott Was a Historic Moment in the Struggle for Justice,"is over, and its time to reflect on the history that was made with this NFL season  and Im not talking about the Eagles. I have a frequent refrain that it is hard to understand a moment in history when youre in it, and there was such a story this year.

This football season, there was a boycott of the NFL by fans who were determined to stand in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who has been effectively blacklisted from the league for his protests against police brutality and systematic racism.

The people who participated in the boycott are among those who, though they might not realize it, are in the middle of a crucial moment in history.

When it became clear, last summer, that the NFL was going to effectively ban Kaepernick, with all 32 teams refusing to even give him a tryout, I announced that I would be boycotting the NFL and asked people to join me.

I knew that boycotting football would not be easy for many people: It was very hard for me! I love the NFL. The call to boycott was asking a lot of people: to turn off the TV, cancel Game Pass, and do something, anything, other than watching an NFL game. Like many others, watching football has been a Sunday ritual in my life for decades.

But Martin Luther King Jr.s words still ring true: Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

What the NFL did to Kaepernick is a historic injustice because it is part of a larger pattern. In the prime of his career, when he is as young, healthy, and strong as hell ever be, in a season in which 20 different teams had quarterbacks go down with injuries, in a season in which over 100 different men were hired as quarterbacks in the NFL, he was never even given a chance  like too many African-Americans.

It is wrong when it happens to a guy from your block, and it is wrong when it happens to a sports star. Its as wrong as it was to ban Muhammad Ali from boxing when he refused to fight in Vietnam. And even worse, Kaepernick, unlike Ali, didnt even break the law (however unjust the law that Ali broke was). The NFL banned the man from the league, denying him the right to earn a living doing what he seems born to do, because he peacefully protested police brutality in this nation.

took action because I believed we would be mistaken to support a corporation that would deny a qualified man employment because he peacefully stood against injustice.

I actually think we succeeded in our boycott of the NFL. But what does success in this context look like?

The Super Bowl was a huge match-up and, by all accounts, a great game. But the ratings just came out and it was the least-watched Super Bowl in nine years. We were part of that.

The ratings for the whole NFL season came out this past month, and they were down by 10 percent  one of the largest single-season drops in recent history. We were part of that.

Now heres the thing: Kaepernick is still not in the NFL. It might be tempting to consider that and wonder if our boycott failed. But thats not the right way to think about this effort.

Consider, for example, how much organizing went into the protests against the NFL. How often in recent American history have so many of us have come together, sacrificed something we truly love, and boycotted it for an entire year? No matter how big the boycott was, the fact that it was there and that it was sustained is a success itself.

Its hard to gauge just how many African-Americans participated in the NFL boycott this year, but it seems exceedingly likely that our families played a large part in this protest. The organization of what is surely a large number African-American households around a protest movement is itself another success.

That sort of organizing, that sort of commitment, is something to be proud of. I know for a fact that Kaepernick is proud of us, too. That pride we can and should feel  thats a success, too.

For too long, weve allowed people and brands and corporations to take our money without demanding that they treat us with the respect we deserve. This year could be a tipping point for us, when millions finally said, You know what: Enough is enough.

I will not trade my dignity for some entertainment. I will not trade my self-respect for recreation.

Many readers have asked if we should continue the boycott. My answer is to look at these successes. My answer is yes. We should never support a corporation that has done to a man what the NFL has done to Colin Kaepernick. Because if a company can do it to him and we accept it, they can do it to any of us.",1.0
2018-02-09,Reuters,Trump taps US Pacific Commander Harris as ambassador to Australia,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday named U.S. Pacific Commander Admiral Harry Harris, who is known for his hawkish views on Chinas military expansion, as his pick to serve as the American ambassador to Australia, the White House said in a statement.

The naval officer has served in the military for 39 years and is in his seventh command assignment as head of the U.S. Pacific Command, according to the White House.

During Harris tenure as head of U.S. forces in the Pacific, tensions over North Koreas missile and nuclear programs increased as President Donald Trumps administration and Pyongyang exchanged threats.

Harris, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, favors diplomacy in countering North Koreas missile threat.

Harris is also known for his combative views on Beijings South China Sea expansion and a strong supporter of so-called freedom of navigation operations under which U.S. ships and aircraft challenge other countries maritime claims.

He upset China by dubbing its construction of islands and building-up of military facilities in the South China Sea as a great wall of sand.

Two deadly collisions involving U.S. warships in the Pacific also occurred during his time as head of Pacific Command.

Ten sailors aboard the guided missile destroyer John S. McCain died when it collided with a tanker near Singapore on Aug. 21. Its sister ship, the Fitzgerald, almost sank off the Japanese coast on June 17 after colliding with a container ship. Seven crew died.

Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the Harris likely replacement was Admiral Philip Davidson, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces Command.

The officials did not comment on when an announcement could be made and any replacement will have to be approved by the U.S. Senate.",1.0
2018-02-10,Western Journal,2012 Obama Campaign Manager Donald Trump Can Absolutely Be Re-Elected in 2020,"A number of prominent Democrats are looking forward to the 2018 midterm elections with anticipation as they predict excitement among the partys voters will lead to important congressional wins.

Jim Messina, who served as campaign manager during President Barack Obamas 2012 re-election campaign, shared that sentiment during a recent appearance on MSNBCs Morning Joe.

When co-host Katty Kay asked whether he believed the 2020 presidential election would also undoubtedly tilt in his partys direction, however, he hedged his bets.

Can he do it again? she asked, referring to President Donald Trumps ability in 2016 to rally supporters in key states and eke out an electoral victory.

I think Donald Trump can absolutely be re-elected, Messina said.

The enthusiasm he expressed earlier in the interview, he explained, dealt specifically with the upcoming midterms. As in previous election cycles, he said turnout that is lower than in presidential years tends to benefit the party out of power.

In that scenario, it matters how intense your voters are, he said. It matters how excited your people are to come vote in an election that is not as sexy, is not as big as a presidential campaign.

Even if the White House is not at stake, Messina noted that 2018 offers Democrats the opportunity for executive-branch victories.

If you care about the presidential race, you actually care more about the governorships, he said.

With perennial swing states Florida, Ohio and Michigan holding gubernatorial elections, Messina said he will be focusing on these races.

Those matter even more and thats where intensity really matters in some of these close governorships, he said.

While he expressed optimism in the Democratic Partys effort to make Trump a one-term president, Messina cautioned that it would take a combination of the right candidate with the right message for the time.

We have to nominate a candidate who can move forward an economic message that motivates this country, he said.

Until that is accomplished, he said, nothing is certain about the 2020 election.

Democrats should be absolutely not confident in our ability to beat Donald Trump until we can do some of this, Messina added.

The field of potential contenders is already crowded, according to Messina. He said a recent trip to Iowa, home of the earliest campaigning each presidential election cycle, led to his realization that there are over 20 people currently considering running for president of the United States as a Democrat.

Though it remains far too early to predict the final lineup of candidates, Messina said Democrats, in general, seem far more engaged in the process than he has seen in the past several cycles.

I have not seen excitement in Iowa Democratic voters like that since 2006, since before the 2008 election, he said. And that is really important.

2018-02-11,Instapundit,DEREGULATION PROCEEDS Administration Imposes Sweeping Limits on Federal Actions Against Companies,"The Trump administration has adopted new limits on the use of guidance documents that federal agencies have issued on almost every conceivable subject, an action that could have sweeping implications for the governments ability to sue companies accused of violations.

Guidance documents offer the governments interpretation of laws, and often when individuals or companies face accusations of legal violations, what they have really violated are the guidance documents. Defense lawyers say the change in policy gives them a powerful tool to fend off allegations of wrongdoing against their clients.

It also advances a goal declared by President Trump in his first days in office: to reduce the burden and cost of federal rules and requirements. But consumer advocates say the move will crimp enforcement of crucial protections.

The new policy, issued by the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, Rachel L. Brand, is significant because federal agencies have issued hundreds of guidance documents on a wide range of laws covering issues like health care, the environment, civil rights and labor.",0.0

""I will work with the [Ku Klux] Klan, with socialists  I exclude communists of course  any patriotic organization that is in general agreement with my beliefs and principles,"" Jones said, who has already tried to run for Congress five times beginning in 1998.

Jones, a health-insurance agent, was a member of the National Socialist White People's Party, previously known as the American Nazi Party, for nearly eight years. He has also been a member of America First Committee since the 1980s, the Atlantic reported.

The 70-year-old also told the Atlantic that he was upset that US President Donald Trump appointed so many people of the Jewish faith in his administration. ""There's a whole layer of other Jews that you don't see that actually make the policy,"" Jones asserted.

In addition, some of his goals include ending America's war in the Middle East, which he claims only benefits Israel, and clamping down on sanctuary cities. His website includes other bullet points including banning same-sex marriage and abortion, and includes images he claims are documents claiming that the Holocaust, which killed over six million European Jews during World War II, is a hoax.

The Anti-Defamation League refers to Jones as a ""longtime neo-Nazi."" The state GOP has also condemned Jones' decision to run for Congress.

2018-02-12,The Verge,Asus ZenFone 5 leaked with dual selfie cameras,"The ZenFone 4 from Asus launched in North America just a few months ago, but the ZenFone 5 sequel is already leaking out. Evan Blass just dropped a few photos and specs of the upcoming ZenFone 5 Lite on Twitter (as spotted by Android Police). Most notably, the phone has a quad-camera setup: two 20MP sensors in the front, and two 16MP sensors in the back.

Dual selfie cameras are crowding into the mid-tier Android phone space. While flagship phones are content with fancy software (Google) and exotic sensors (Apple) to get interesting selfie results, Samsungs A8, Oppos F3, Vivos X9s, and Huaweis Honor 9 Lite are all dual selfie camera phones that have been announced in the past year.

The big question is if Asus will be able to build useful software to combine the two cameras into the bokeh selfies we all crave (like Samsungs Live Focus mode on the A8), or if the cameras will work independently to merely provide different fields of view (like on the Oppo F3).

Evan also mentions that the phone will have a FHD+ screen, which means a 2160 x 1080 resolution in a 18:9 aspect ratio, and that it will be available in midnight black, moonlight white, and rouge red.

If the ZenFone 5 Lite is priced similarly to the ZenFone 4, it could hit in the $300-ish range, if or when it arrives in the US.",1.0
2018-02-13,Buzzfeed,A Democratic Activist Is Primarying Bob Menendez Even If Thats An Extremely Uphill Battle,"Last month, federal prosecutors decided not to retry Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez after a lengthy corruption case against him ended in mistrial.

Menendez is a free man, but is still facing a renewed Senate Ethics Committee investigation and is somewhat at odds with more left-leaning Democrats. Its the kind of situation that could lead to a contentious primary with a number of challengers, especially with an energized grassroots base motivated to run for office in the age of Trump.

But Menendez has drawn just one primary challenger: activist and pundit Michael Starr Hopkins.

Hopkins said the speed with which the New Jersey Democratic establishment endorsed the senator following the mistrial drove him to challenge the senators reelection bid  as well as Menendezs post-mistrial statement. (To those who were digging my political grave so they could jump into my seat, I know who you are and I wont forget you, Menendez said in front of the federal courthouse.)

Menendez had faced legal scrutiny over his relationship with a major donor, a Florida ophthalmologist. During the trial, former US senator Robert Torricelli (who faced his own scrutiny over a donor) worked behind the scenes to position himself as the successor of Menendezs seat if he was forced to resign from office. But little momentum for a challenge  primarily against New Jersey's Democratic machine  has materialized.

John Wisniewski, a former progressive candidate for governor and NJ assemblyman, said theres a slim chance of success for anyone looking to challenge Menendez, whos already shored up support from Democratic power players including current governor Phil Murphy and popular New Jersey junior senator Cory Booker. The senator also has a hefty amount of cash ($4.1 million) on hand ahead of the April filing deadline.

Fundraising is going to be tough. Were not going to go dollar for dollar with Menendez, said Hopkins, whose campaign has raised $26,268 according to Federal Election Commission data, but he hopes that New Jerseyans will connect with someone running for office who isnt a party insider.

Despite the quick lineup behind Menendez, a poll, conducted by the Rutgers-Eagleton Poll, found that 51% of New Jersey voters thought that Menendez didnt deserve reelection and 49% thought that he should resign. The poll surveyed 600 New Jersey adults after the mistrial was declared last November.

The poll also found that New Jerseyans who were informed about the senators corruption trial first were more likely to say he didnt deserve reelection, and Hopkins doesnt shy away from mentioning the corruption charges. Hopkins says that hes running partly because he wants to protect the Senate seat for Democrats. Losing this one seat, this one vote could have a major impact on policies (like health care) that protect lots of Americans, Hopkins said.

Hes also running on the heels of Murphys 2017 campaign, in which he ran on a litany of liberal goals, from a $15 minimum wage to legalized marijuana. Foreign policy progressives have already complained that Menendez  who holds somewhat more hawkish views on Cuba and Iran than some Democrats  has regained his position as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",1.0
2018-02-16,Live Action,Columnist Florida shooting could have been prevented if mother aborted,"After a tragedy like a mass shooting, its understandable that people try to find ways to prevent them from happening again. However, one Twitter user had a suggestion that left people horrified: more abortions. Becky Griffin is an Israeli model, TV presenter and actress, and she took to Twitter to suggest that more people should have abortions to stop people like Cruz from perpetrating mass murders.

The nation is currently in mourning after 17 people were killed in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida. Nikolas Cruz, a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was the shooter, and he was also an adopted child who had mental health problems. His adoptive father had died several years prior to the shooting, and his adoptive mother died of pneumonia in November. He had since been living with friends.

The tweet immediately got backlash, but Griffin didnt back down:

She quickly jumped to the notion of mental illness being genetic  and therefore, Cruz again should have been aborted.

Its horrifically offensive, but sadly, Griffins take is not unusual: people who are considered unfit should not be having children. People who are pro-abortion frequently defend the notion of aborting babies purely because of their race, socioeconomic status, or disability. Griffins argument in favor of aborting children to prevent crime isnt unheard of, either; these screeds are often tinged with racism, as showed most notably by abortionist Ron Virmani, who said that people need to abort their ugly black babies because they will only grow up to be criminals.

Even pro-abortion activists were outraged at Griffins statements:

There is no excuse for such horrific rhetoric. It is wrong, it is offensive, and it is often racist or  as in this case  ableist. Griffin should issue an apology, and perhaps do some soul-searching.",0.0
2018-02-23,Fox News,Why Trumps promise to move US Embassy to Jerusalem is so controversial,"President Trump announced late last year that the U.S. will formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  and it looks like the new U.S. embassy will be ready ahead of schedule.

The U.S. embassy in Jerusalem will open in May in order to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel declaring its independence, the Trump administration said on Feb. 23.

The Trump administrations decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital was heralded by many pro-Israel activists but decried by Palestinians and Americas Arab allies.

Read on to find out why the decision is so contentious  and why it wasnt accomplished before.

The international community  and until 2017, the U.S.  largely does not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as it is claimed by both Palestinians and Israelis. Like other countries, the U.S. kept its embassy in Tel Aviv, approximately an hour away.

The U.S. moving its embassy would cause significant harm to the U.S. credibility as a mediator for peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, said Dylan Williams, vice president of government affairs for J Street, a left-leaning pro-Israel advocacy organization.

Williams added that the move could undermine confidence from Palestinians and Arab countries that the U.S. would remain an impartial negotiator in efforts to create peace in the Middle East.

It shouldnt be moved prior to agreement by the parties to the conflict as part of a comprehensive agreement ending their conflict, Williams, J Streets chief lobbyist, told Fox News.

Williams added that such a move could also turn deadly.

Even seemingly minor changes of Jerusalems status quo  either in fact or in law  have historically had the impact of sparking violence, Williams said.

Millions of evangelical eyes were on Trump, waiting to see if he would keep his campaign promise to move the embassy, longtime Pastor John Hagee told Fox News ahead of the president's official announcement.

""I can assure you that 60 million evangelicals are watching this promise closely because if President Trump moves the embassy into Jerusalem, he will historically step into immortality,"" Hagee said. ""He will be remembered for thousands of years for his act of courage to treat Israel like we already treat other nations.""

""If he does not, he will be remembered as just another president who made a promise he failed to keep which would generate massive disappointment in that strong evangelical base that went to vote for him against Hillary Clinton,"" he added.

Hagee is the founder and senior pastor of Cornerstone Church, a megachurch in San Antonio, Texas. He founded the nonprofit Christians United for Israel in 2006, as well.

A March 2016 Gallup poll found that the majority of Americans didnt express an opinion when asked if the U.S. embassy should move from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But of those who did have an opinion, Americans were split with 24 percent supporting a move and 20 percent disagreeing with relocation.

Trump isnt the only president to declare his intentions to move the U.S. embassy; both former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush also pledged to move the embassy  only to abandon the idea once in the White House.

Congress approved in 1995 the funding and relocation of the embassy to Jerusalem by 1999. But the law included a stipulation, allowing for presidents to sign continuous waivers to stall the relocation. Every president since has used the waiver in an effort to avoid conflict with the peace negotiations.

2018-03-13,The Hill,Home prices soar high as Federal Reserve hopes to avoid big crash,"After the peak of the housing bubble in 2006, U.S. home prices fell for six years, until 2012. Are these memories getting a little hazy? The Federal Reserve, through forcing years of negative real short-term interest rates, suppressing long-term rates, and financing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the tune of $1.8 trillion on its own vastly expanded balance sheet, set out to make home prices go back up. It succeeded. Indeed, it has overachieved. Average home prices are now significantly higher than they were at the top of the bubble, as shown by the S&P Case-Shiller national home price index.

If you already own a home, the price boom makes you feel richer. But if you are trying to buy, it makes homes less and less affordable. home prices rise not only faster than inflation, but faster than your income. So far, we have spoken of nominal home prices. But since the old 2006 peak, we have had more than a decade of general inflation, as the Fed strives for perpetual depreciation of the dollars purchasing power at a rate of 2 percent a year. The aggregate increase of the consumer price index from 2006 to 2017 was about 24 percent. We need to consider home prices on a real, or inflation-adjusted, basis.

From 1987 to 2000, the average inflation-adjusted annual increase in U.S. home prices was 0.3 percent. This 0.3 percent annual rate is the same as the very long term trend increase in U.S. real home prices, as calculated over the 117 years from 1900 to 2017, by the Credit Suisse global investment returns yearbook for 2018. In other words, in addition to giving you a nice place to live, it appears that over time on average, homes provide a good inflation hedge, plus a little, but not plus very much. After 2000, in real terms the housing bubble expanded and contracted quite symmetrically, bottoming out in 2012 just about on its trend line.

But it did not resume its trend behavior. The Fed was on the case, and up real home prices went rapidly again, rising over 5 percent a year on average from 2012 to 2017. Their current real level is equal to that of mid-2004, when the bubble was already well inflated, and it is far over  28 percent over  their trend line as extended from 2000.

Nobel Prize winner Robert Shillers estimate of U.S. home price increases since 1953, compared to the increase in the consumer price index, shows that the two track very closely for decades. But they swiftly part company as the 2000s housing bubble inflated, get pretty close again by 2012 as home prices corrected, then once more dramatically diverged, and are now far apart.

Looking at the pattern of real home prices, I conclude that because of the Fed, home prices are too high, and real home prices will fall. Of course, this does not mean that nominal prices must fall. They could go basically sideways for some time, while inflation continues year after year, as the Fed plans, and real prices would be falling. The supply of new home construction has been much more constrained than in the last cycle, which is consistent with this scenario.

That would be a soft landing, as is always wished for, and might turn out to be consistent with the Feds gradualism in undoing its home price inflation program. The Fed is letting its mortgage-backed securities portfolio run off through maturities and prepayments, not selling any of the $1.8 trillion it still owns, and the same for its $2.4 trillion of long-term Treasury debt. It is raising step by step its target short-term interest rates, but they are still very low and negative in real terms. Nominal short rates of 1.5 percent compared to inflation of 2 percent, obviously gives you a negative 0.5 percent real yield. In a normalized financial world, the real yield will be positive, not negative.

Falling real home prices might also be composed of part inflation and part declining nominal home prices. That would be consistent with rising nominal and real long-term interest rates. Since 1971, 10-year Treasury note yield has averaged 2.5 percent more than the CPI inflation rate. Interest rates on 30-year mortgages have averaged over these years 1.7 percent more than the 10-year Treasury. If inflation runs at 2 percent, that gives us 2 percent plus 2.5 percent plus 1.7 percent, or in total 6.2 percent, as the normalized mortgage interest rate. That is a lot higher than the current 4.5 percent and would certainly restrain or dampen home prices. The timing, and whether the landing will be soft or not, is just what nobody knows or can know.

What can the Fed do about this? Nearly a decade after the 2008 crisis, it needs to withdraw its radical interest rate and investment interventions. I am certain that the Fed does not want to find out what would happen in the market if it actually put its mortgage-backed securities and long-term Treasuries out for bids from Wall Street. So about all, it can continue with the gradualist program, keep up its rhetoric about how very gradual everything is, and hope home prices have a soft landing. It is said that hope is not a strategy. But thats the best the Fed has at this point. The rest of us should constrain leverage in the housing sector as the fall in real home prices unfolds.

2018-03-21,Fortune,A Short History of the US Not Winning Trade Wars,"President Trump says that winning a trade war is easy, but a closer look at history suggests otherwise. Of course, the most famous example of protectionism gone awry is 1930s Smoot-Hawley Tariff Actwhich along with similar protectionist measures enacted around the globehelped torpedo world trade and exacerbate the Great Depression. Since that time U.S. has charted a course toward freer world trade, but when it has unilaterally deviated from that direction, it has usually paid a price.

President Nixon helped usher in the era of stagflation in the 1970s by relying on temporary across-the-board tariffs and currency revaluation rather than higher interest rates and budgetary restraint to stabilize rapidly growing trade deficits with countries like Japan. In 2002, President Bush implemented his own across the board tariffs on steel to protect American companies, but those measures hit fierce resistance by other members of the World Trade Organization, and were quietly lifted without doing much to staunch the loss of steel manufacturing jobs, while hurting job growth further down the supply chain.

The current administrations proposal takes U.S. trade policy into uncharted waters, says Peter Schott of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, because it is being justified on national security grounds. Though the WTO has always allowed members to institute tariffs to protect national security, these provisions have been little used, for fear that the international body is simply not equipped to decide what constitutes a member countrys national security interests. The tariffs underlying justification should be read as a shot across the bow to the WTO itself, Schott says, suggesting that the Trump Administration has written off the WTOs ability to fairly arbitrate trade disagreements.

With the administration questioning the very foundations of a generation of global trade policy, its tough to know just how U.S. partners will react, but the European Unions threat to institute retaliatory tariffs against goods like Kentucky bourbon and Harley Davidson motorcycles, suggests they wont take it lying down.",1.0

2018-03-28,Alternet,Our Broken Politics Are Killing Americas People with Legal Heroin,"Our Broken Politics Are Killing America's People with Legal Heroin

Our broken politics are killing our people and threatening our country with legalized heroin. Children in our district and across America are growing up with no mother because she died using Fentanyl. Pills with the exact same biochemistry as heroin are being sold for billions to our children and our people.

There is no better proof of our broken political system than this fact.



While jobs, health care and education suffer from chronic neglect in our broken political system, the most dangerous aspect is an acute crisis that has been deliberately created by drug companies selling legal heroin, while using profits to ensure its legal status. That is the epitome of a broken political system.



We need look no further than our 21st congressional district, and then across much of our nation, to see the tragedy of our broken politics with the opioid/heroin epidemic. Across global history, what nation's politics would not only allow, but encourage the killing of their children in order that a few can make profits?



Over the last decades, giant pharmaceutical companies such as Purdue, have led an active campaign to push opioid abuse across the population, most horrendously with our children, leaving a trail of sorrow, death and destruction across our communities. At the same time, these corporate drug-pushers pocket billions of dollars.



Our broken politics are killing our children. No society can survive that. The only threat to our great potential is our own willingness to allow legal heroin as a product in our country.

How can we as parents, friends and fellow Americans allow this to continue? America will not be brought to its knees by any foreign threat, but by our own greed and our own indifference. The first step in fixing health care is ending this terrible epidemic, and to do that, we must fix our broken politics.

Together, we can fix this.

2018-06-11,MotherJones,Sessions Makes It Vastly Harder for Victims of Domestic Abuse and Gang Violence to Receive Asylum,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions has just made it dramatically harder for victims of violence to receive asylum in the United States. Using his authority over the US immigration court system, Sessions decided Monday that people fleeing gangs and domestic violence will generally not qualify for asylum.

To receive asylum, applicants have to show they were persecuted because of characteristics such as their race, religion, or membership in a particular social group. Sessions wrote Monday that a gangs victims have not necessarily been targeted on account of their membership in a social group just because the gang harassed a certain geographical area. He expressed similar skepticism about domestic violence claims, overturning a 2014 case that established that married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship can count as a social group.

Sessions decision requires asylum seekers to show that their government has condoned the violence committed by non-governmental actors or demonstrated an inability to protect victims. Generally, claims by aliens pertaining to domestic violence or gang violence perpetrated by non-governmental actors will not qualify for asylum, he wrote. While I do not decide that violence inflicted by non-governmental actors may never serve as the basis for an asylum or withholding application based on membership in a particular social group, in practice such claims are unlikely to satisfy the statutory grounds for proving group persecution.

Michelle Brane, the director of the Migrant Rights and Justice program at the Womens Refugee Commission, calls the decision a devastating blow to families who come to the United States seeking protection. What this means in practical terms is that the United States is turning its back on our commitment to never again send people back to a country where their life is at risk, she says in an email. Women and children will die as a result of these policies.

Michael Kagan, a law professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, explained the implications of Sessions decision on Twitter:

Sessions was weighing in specifically on the case of a Salvadoran woman known as Ms. A-B-, who sought asylum in the United States after surviving 15 years of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse at the hands of her ex-husband, with whom she has three children. She attempted to escape him by moving to another Salvadoran town, obtaining restraining orders, and divorcing him, but the threats and violence continued, according to her court filings. The mans brother was a police officer, and the authorities did little to intervene, once telling her, If you have any dignity, you will get out of here. So she did, traveling to the United States in June 2014 and applying for asylum.

There was no guarantee of success. Since 2014, immigration court precedent has made it clear that survivors of domestic violence can qualify for asylum only if the violence rises to the level of persecution and their government is unable or unwilling to protect them. But the immigration court judges who evaluate asylum claims like Ms A-B-s have widely varying track records, with some granting asylum to the vast majority of applicants and others approving fewer than 5 percent. Ms. A-B-s case was assigned to one of the strictest judges in the country: V. Stuart Couch in Charlotte, who has a 14 percent asylum approval rate, according to one analysis, as well as a history of having his rulings overturned after he denied asylum to women fleeing domestic violence. So it was no surprise when he refused to grant Ms. A-B- asylumor when the Justice Departments Board of Immigration Appeals reversed his decision.

Thats where Sessions comes in. As head of the Justice Department, which includes the immigration courts, the attorney general has the power to intervene in cases to determine how immigration law is interpreted. Before Ms. A-B-s asylum status was formally granted (Couch delayed approving it), Sessions stepped in, referring the case to himself for review and leaving Ms. A-B- in limbo.

Sessions foreshadowed the decision during a speech to immigration judges Monday morning, saying he would soon be issuing a decision that restores sound principles of asylum and long-standing principles of immigration law.

The decision is in line with other steps Sessions and the Trump administration have taken to undercut the American asylum system. The month after President Donald Trumps inaugurationand after Trumps executive order to suspend the US refugee programthe Department of Homeland Security made it harder for asylum seekers arriving at the border to pass an initial screening. Those who did pass were increasingly locked up without the possibility of parole in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers. In January, US Citizenship and Immigration Services ordered immigration judges to rule on more recent asylum applications before older ones, diminishing asylum seekers ability to remain in the safety of the United States while their applications move through the courts. And in March, Sessions canceled a four-year-old Board of Immigration Appeals ruling that gave asylum seekers the right to a full hearing.

Last month, Sessions revoked immigration judges broad authority to close cases through a process known as administrative closure after referring a different case to himself. The procedure does not provide permanent residency, but it can allow immigrants to live in the United States indefinitely. The decision could force immigration judges to reopen many of the roughly 350,000 cases that were administratively closed before the end of the 2017 fiscal year, despite the fact that there is already a more than 700,000-case backlog.

For months, its been unclear to both Ms. A-B-s legal team and DHS lawyers what question, exactly, Sessions planned to weigh in on. Advocates feared he would attempt to roll back the legal precedent that allows victims of gender-based violenceincluding female genital cutting, forced marriage, and anti-LGBT violence, along with domestic abuseto seek sanctuary in the United States. In his March order intervening in the case, the attorney general asked both sides for arguments on whether being the victim of private criminal activity like domestic or gang violence can qualify a person for asylum. But the answeryes, under certain conditionshas been a well-established principle in asylum law since 1980, says Ms. A-B-s lawyer, Blaine Bookey of the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California-Hastings. To overturn that, he would be overturning 30 years of precedent.

Last fall, Sessions hinted in a speech that he would try to limit the circumstances under which asylum can be granted. Our asylum laws are meant to protect those who, because of characteristics like their race, religion, nationality, or political opinions cannot find protection in their home countries, he said. They were never intended to provide asylum to all those who fear generalized violence, crime, personal vendettas, or a lack of job prospects.",1.0
2018-06-11,PBS,Supreme Court allows Ohio 8216voter purge8217,"WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court is allowing Ohio to clean up its voting rolls by targeting people who havent cast ballots in a while.

The justices rejected, by a 5-4 vote Monday, arguments that the practice violates a federal law intended to increase the ranks of registered voters. A handful of other states also use voters inactivity to trigger a process that could lead to their removal from the voting rolls.

Justice Samuel Alito said for the court that Ohio is complying with the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. He was joined by his four conservative colleagues.

Partisan fights over ballot access are being fought across the country. Democrats have accused Republicans of trying to suppress votes from minorities and poorer people who tend to vote for Democrats. Republicans have argued that they are trying to promote ballot integrity and prevent voter fraud.

Under Ohio rules, registered voters who fail to vote in a two-year period are targeted for eventual removal from registration rolls, even if they havent moved and remain eligible. The state said it only uses the disputed process after first comparing its voter lists with a U.S. postal service list of people who have reported a change of address. But not everyone who moves notifies the post office, the state said.

So the state asks people who havent voted in two years to confirm their eligibility. If they do, or if they show up to vote over the next four years, voters remain registered. If they do nothing, their names eventually fall off the list of registered voters.

2018-06-11,Washington Post,Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump made at least 82 million in outside income last year while serving i,"Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the presidents daughter and son-in-law, brought in at least $82 million in outside income while serving as senior White House advisers during 2017, according to financial disclosure forms released Monday.

Trump earned $3.9 million from her stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington and more than $2 million in severance from the Trump Organization, while Kushner reported over $5 million in income from Quail Ridge, a Kushner Cos. apartment complex acquired last year in Plainsboro, N.J.

The filings show how the couple are collecting immense sums from other enterprises while serving in the White House, an extraordinary income flow that ethics experts have warned could create potential conflicts of interests.

Both Kushner and Trump have given up daily oversight of their companies as they work as unpaid senior advisers to the president.

But while Kushner divested some holdings, he and his wife have maintained large stakes in businesses with domestic and foreign ties. Kushners family real estate company has properties around the country, including thousands of apartment units in states including New Jersey and Maryland. Trumps eponymous clothing and accessories line is produced exclusively in foreign factories in countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia and China.

Last year, Kushners assets were worth between $179 million and $735 million, while Trumps assets were valued between about $55.3 million and $75.6 million, according to a Washington Post estimate of their filings. Some of their assets were jointly listed.

It is difficult to calculate net worth using the forms, in part because the Office of Government Ethics uses broad ranges for assets and liabilities.

In an email statement, Peter Mirijanian  a spokesman for Abbe Lowell, Kushners and Trumps ethics counsel  said that the couple have followed all ethics rules and that Mondays disclosures are an insufficient way to understand the nuances of their net worth.

Since joining the administration, Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have complied with the rules and restrictions as set out by the Office of Government Ethics, Mirijanian said. As to the current filing which OGE also reviews, their net worth remains largely the same, with changes reflecting more the way the form requires disclosure than any substantial difference in assets or liabilities.

In their last financial disclosure, filed in July 2017, the couple reported jointly making at least $19 million in income from business ventures and $80 million in real estate and other revenue between January 2016 and the first months of 2017.

Because their newest filings cover a shorter period of time  the 2017 calendar year  and include some income that was previously disclosed, it is impossible to make a direct comparison to their previous reported income.

Trump earned at least $12 million last year, with the largest source of income coming from the trust that oversees her clothing brand, which paid her more than $5 million, the filings show.

The new filings reflect a change in the structure of Trumps payments from limited-liability companies affiliated with the Trump Organization. Trump will now receive guaranteed fixed yearly payments instead of payments based on profits from three companies tied to the Trump Organizations international projects.

The change was made in consultation with Office of Government Ethics officials to reduce her interest in the performance of the business, according to her filing. Her share of that payment in 2017 was $747,622, the filing shows.

Trumps $2 million in severance came after she left the Trump Organization in January of last year when her father was inaugurated. She officially joined the White House as an unpaid senior adviser in March 2017, after her initial attempts to serve as an informal adviser raised ethics questions.

Trump was also paid a $289,300 advance by Penguin Random House for her book, Women Who Work, which she donated to the Ivanka M. Trump Charitable Fund to distribute grants to support women and girls.

For his part, Kushner reported drawing income from dozens of companies tied to his familys real estate company. In all, he pulled in at least $70 million, the documents show.

[Jared Kushner receives permanent security clearance, an indication he may no longer be a focus of the special counsel]

Kushner disclosed that he had failed last year to report several stakes in limited-liability companies  including Vegas Seven, an online news publication in Las Vegas, and the Veggie Grill, a restaurant in Manhattan Beach, Calif. The filing noted that Kushner divested himself of his stakes before joining the White House but did not report the assets previously because of an accounting oversight.

Kushner Cos. has reported more than $2 billion in transactions in the past two years, including developments in Times Square and Jersey City. A Washington Post analysis of his holdings last year showed that Kushner had retained about 90 percent of his real estate holdings.

Before entering the White House, Kushner sold his stake in 666 Fifth Ave., the Kushner Cos. Manhattan building plagued by debt of more than $1 billion, to a trust controlled by his mother. (Kushner is not a beneficiary of the trust.)

In a wide-ranging interview in late May with the Real Deal, a New York City real estate publication, Kushners father derided ethics watchdogs as jerks who cant get a real job and suggested that the criticism may discourage rich and successful people from taking government positions.

I look at what my kids have sacrificed to go into government, with the only intent of doing good for this country and for the world, and to help people, Charles Kushner told the Real Deal. And what they have sacrificed, and the daily barrage of negative media, and the attacks they get, and they had a perfect, beautiful life and they still have a very good life, but they sacrificed a lot.

The White House also released the financial disclosures of more than two dozen other staffers Monday.

National security adviser John Bolton reported making $2.2 million in income last year, including $569,000 from Fox News, where he was a paid contributor. Bolton also received a $240,000 salary from the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and $155,000 from the Gatestone Institute  a group that has raised fears about Muslims in Europe, sometimes through claims that have been debunked. Bolton served as that groups chairman.

Bolton also reported $165,000 from Counter Extremism Project United, a nonprofit entity that seeks to combat extremist groups, and $747,000 from speaking fees.

The largest speaking fees came from a foundation run by Ukrainian steel magnate Viktor Pinchuk, which paid Bolton $115,000 for speeches in September 2017 and February 2018. Pinchuk, who generally advocates for closer ties between Ukraine and the West, also donated $150,000 to President Trumps charitable foundation in exchange for a short speech Trump made to one of Pinchuks conferences by video in 2015.

Bolton also reported $118,000 for speaking to large banks: Deutsche Bank paid him $72,000 for a speech in May 2017, and British bank HSBC paid him $46,000 for speeches in June and August 2017.

Christopher Liddell, the deputy chief of staff for policy coordination and a former executive at Microsoft and General Motors, reported income from capital gains and interest from investments in dozens of companies, technology projects and real estate.

2018-06-14,ABC News,House Speaker Paul Ryan opposes family separation policy at border,"House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., spoke out Thursday against the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border while blaming the policy on recent court rulings rather than the Trump administration's actions, saying hes not comfortable with the policy.

""We don't want kids to be separated from their parents,"" he said at his weekly news conference.

The House is expected to vote on two Republican immigration proposals next week that would limit legal immigration levels and deal with border security and the status of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers.

One of those bills  a compromise measure GOP conservatives and moderates are still drafting  includes provision prohibiting the separation of children and parents at the border, according to a draft of the legislation obtained by ABC News.

The bill, which also authorizes funding for a border wall and includes changes to the visa program and a pathway to legal status for young undocumented immigrants, clarifies the 1997 legal agreement known as the Flores settlement, which requires the government to release and not detain undocumented immigration children.

In court rulings, the federal government has pointed to the settlement to justify the family separation policy.

The new legislation, if signed into law, would require that accompanied alien minors apprehended at the border remain with parents or legal guardians while in custody of the Department of Homeland Security, according to a draft of the proposal.

The White House has signaled support for the effort, though it's unclear if either measure has the support to clear the House, and whether they would be considered in the Senate.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Thursday defended the policy in response to questions from reporters.

Its a moral policy to follow and enforce the law, Sanders said.

Dont you have any empathy? Brian Karem, a correspondent for Playboy, shouted out at Sanders. Youre a parent of young children.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the policy on Thursday by citing the Bible.

Illegal entry into the United States is a crime  as it should be and must be if youre going to have a legal system whatsoever, he said.

Ryan said Thursday that the policy was the result of a court ruling  a reference to the Flores settlement  rather than a change in administration policy under President Trump.

But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., pushed back on that assessment, and said Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department could quickly reverse the ""barbaric"" policy.

""It can be changed just like that,"" she said, snapping her fingers.

The family separation is a result of the zero tolerance policy enacted by the Justice Department to deter illegal border crossings, by prosecuting more immigrants for illegal entry.

""If you don't want your child separated,"" Sessions said last month, ""then don't bring them across the border illegally. It's not our fault someone does that.""

Last week a federal judge in California ruled that a lawsuit challenging the administration's practice brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) could proceed.

The lawsuit alleges that the administration is forcibly separating asylum-seekers from their children upon arrival.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement argued in court filings that separating migrant parents and children in immigration detention ""serve the legitimate purpose of allowing the government to carry out its immigration and criminal enforcement role"" and that ""plaintiffs have not provided any basis to conclude that there is a due process right to family unity that prohibited the separation.""

Despite the change in administration policy, the White House blamed Democrats for the uptick in family separation, with Sanders on Thursday pointing to legal loopholes that Democrats refuse to close.",1.0
2018-07-19,Newsweek,Akainacephalus johnsoni Armored Dinosaur Species That Lived 76 Million Years Ago Discovered in Utah,"Researchers have uncovered a remarkable set of fossils in southern Utah, belonging to an entirely new species and genus (group of species) of armored dinosaur, according to a study published in the open-access journal PeerJ.

Akainacephalus johnsoni, as the dinosaur has been named, lived around 76 million years ago during the late Cretaceous Period (100.5 million to 66 million years ago) in the southern region of Laramidiaan island continent located to the west of an ocean that once split North America in two.

The bones were found 10 years ago in the Kaiparowits Formationa formation of sedimentary rock in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, Kane Countyduring an expedition led by the Natural History Museum of Utah, although the remains have only recently been prepared and analyzed.

A. johnsoni belongs to a family of dinosaurs known as Ankylosauridaefour-legged herbivorous dinosaurs with imposing bony tail clubs and that originated in what is now Asia between 125 million and 100 million years ago. They later appeared in the fossil record of western North America around 77 million years ago.

The newly discovered fossils represent the most complete skeleton of an ankylosaurid dinosaur ever found in the southwestern United States and could reveal new details about the diversity and evolution of this group. The set of bones includes a complete skull, much of the vertebral column, a complete tail club, several fore and hind limb parts and body armor.

The bones suggest the animal measured between 13 feet and16 feet long and stood 3-and-a-half feet tall at the hips. It was covered in body armor from head to tail.

Intriguingly, the skeleton contains several unique features, including spikes and cones on the bony plate covering the head and snout. These traits are similar to those found on the New Mexican ankylosaurid Nodocephelausaurus kirtlandensis; however, they are distinct from all other known late Cretaceous North American dinosaurs from this family.

See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows

In fact, the two species appear to be much more closely related to Asian ankylosaurids, which have more pronounced spikes covering their skulls.

""A reasonable hypothesis would be that ankylosaurids from Utah are related to those found elsewhere in western North America, so we were really surprised to discover that Akainacephalus was so closely related to species from Asia,"" Randall Irmis, a co-author of the study from the Natural History Museum of Utah, said in a statement.

This close relationship with species from Asia could be explained by a series of migrations during the late Cretaceous Period, which took place when sea levels dropped, exposing the Beringian land bridge. This allowed animals to move between Asia and western North America, or Laramidia.

The fact that North America was split in two meant that these migrants evolved differently to Ankylosaurids in the eastern portion of the continent, hence their distinctive characteristics.

""It is extremely fascinating and important for the science of paleontology that we can read so much information from the fossil record, allowing us to better understand extinct organisms and the ecosystems they were a part of,"" Jelle Wiersma, lead author of the study from James Cook University Australia, said.

2018-07-20,The Independent,A London couple risked disaster to fill their basement flat with light,"Creating an open-plan living space was the key to filling this basement flat with natural light, but the decision to knock down two supporting walls was unprecedented in this Maida Vale row of converted Georgian Grade II-listed houses.

And with good reason: the fate of the five storeys of million-pound homes above rests upon the integrity of the structure below.

The tried-and-tested method usually employed by architects in such circumstances was not going to work.

It was a pretty audacious move, says owner Ben Pugh, 40. But you wouldnt expect any less from the founder of ethical grocery delivery service Farmdrop.

He created the online farmers market to solve another problem  our broken food chain  by paying farmers almost double what supermarkets paid them for their produce.

Ben and his wife Winnie, 37, are giving me a tour of the home they share with their two young children on Farmdrops sixth birthday, just six days after securing a further 10 million investment in the company.

Both from financial backgrounds, the couple are used to taking calculated risks.

They bought the dark, damp basement flat for 1.15 million in 2010, moving from a tiny studio flat up the road. We were excited by the space and knew it had potential, says Winnie.

At 1,800sq ft the three-bedroom flat has more than double the floor space of an average UK home of 893sq ft. Its also uncommonly long, 27 metres, about the length of three London buses.

The flat not only required structural work, it needed complete reconfiguration to make the most of the light that streams in through the back in the morning and moves to the front in the afternoon, but left the middle in a permanent state of semi-darkness.

Even the walled courtyard in the centre of the flat only provided a limited source of natural light.

The couple knew Bens trusted school friend, architect Matthew Wood, was the man for the job.

The natural orientation was to move the kitchen which was in the centre of the space to the big, beautiful room at the front of the flat, says Wood.

It took a lot of time and many discussions to finally decide to flip the rooms so there would be a flow from the kitchen to the garden at the back.

The garden is the other main reason Ben and Winnie bought the flat. Properties in their road are coveted because you can step straight from your home into three acres of private manicured lawn with established trees and unusual plants.

Thats why the previous design of the house was so wrong  this property is all about the garden, says Wood.

Flipping the arrangements required carving the large front room into three, creating space for a bedroom and two bathrooms, while putting the master bedroom in the centre and then the walls partitioning the final third of the house could be knocked down to create the large, open-plan, light-filled kitchen, living and dining room.

This is where the design gets really clever. Wood extended the living space into the courtyard in the centre of the house and built the extension from glass to maximise the natural light.

But he didnt use the whole courtyard; he left about a foot of exterior space, so French doors from the master bedroom could open on to it.

Leaving the gap was a breakthrough moment, says Ben. It was the solution we were looking for to allow light and air into the bedroom.

The glass doors provide a window into the living space and the garden beyond, while still maintaining privacy.

The success of the whole renovation depended on knocking down those two adjoining, load-bearing walls. So how did they solve the problem?

This was extremely complicated. Normally pins would have been inserted perpendicular to the wall to hold the weight before taking bricks out, but this was not possible because the pins would have gone into the flat above.

Instead the engineer designed a temporary support system that involved making holes in the walls and inserting stools all the way around. The double structural frame then clamped around the stools before the wall was removed.

It was terrifying, says Winnie. I had architect friends who said they wouldnt have taken this on. It was a very slow process and a feat of engineering. Wood is now in demand to provide advice to neighbours wanting to do a similar thing.

This part of the project cost 50,000 but the walls were so thick it added 68 square feet of floor space, which in terms of price per square foot meant this move practically paid for itself.

Further space was created by removing radiators and installing underfloor heating. This allowed 4.25 metres of full-depth storage cupboards in the hallway, for Bens surf and ski equipment and guitars, and three metres of walk-in bedroom wardrobes for Winnies clothes.

Eager to continue the light-and-bright theme, the couple painted all the walls white. The floor is done in a pale timber and the manmade stone in the bathroom was specially sourced because it is extra white. The light-grey and teak kitchen and breakfast bar was made bespoke by a small company in Windsor, Berkshire. Even in winter it feels like youre having breakfast outside, says Winnie.

The renovation cost 250,000. It seemed like huge sums of money at the time but in retrospect it was a fantastic investment and value, says Ben.

The project took six months during which time the newly married couple moved in with Bens parents in their two-bedroom pied-a-terre in Notting Hill.

I remember the feeling of coming back and walking in after all the work was done. I still feel that excitement, every time I come home, he says.

2018-07-31,Al Jazeera,15 killed as gunmen storm government building in Jalalabad,"Afghan security forces have battled two gunmen who stormed a government building in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, taking dozens of people hostage.

The siege on Tuesday at the refugees and repatriations directorate compound, which began after a suicide bomber detonated explosives at the building's entrance, lasted for several hours, during which intermittent gunfire and blasts could be heard.

Spokesman Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the government of Nangarhar province, said the incident appeared to be over with two gunmen killed and much of the building destroyed.

He said at least 15 people had been killed and 15 wounded although the total may rise as rescue workers search the site. Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the local provincial council, said eight had been killed and as many as 30 wounded.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

""Around 11am local time, a car laden with explosives, drove up to this compound, two gunmen jumped out and then they set off the first of several explosions, then Afghan Special Forces arrived and a gun battle ensued for the following six hours,"" said Al Jazeera's Charlotte Bellis, reporting from Afghanistan's capital, Kabul.

She added that the targeted building is in a ""very sensitive area, with the United Nations compound next door and a large hospital on the other side"".

According to one witness, a passer-by named Obaidullah, the attack began when a black car with three occupants pulled up at the entrance to a building used by the department of refugee affairs, and a gunman got out firing around him.

One attacker blew himself up at the gate and two gunmen entered the building, which is in an area close to shops and government offices, Obaidullah told Reuters news agency.

Minutes later, the car exploded, wounding people in the street, he said.

""We saw several people wounded and helped to carry them away.""

Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the local provincial council, said around 40 people appeared to be caught inside the building, which caught fire in the initial stages of the attack.

One hostage had called the security services and told them that the attackers had ordered the people inside not to move, he said.

Khogyani said the attack happened during a meeting with NGOs working on refugee-related issues. The head of the directorate and several other people were taken to safety, he said.

The attack is the latest in a series of attacks that hit Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, in recent weeks, killing and wounding dozens of people.

On Saturday, a series of explosions went off in the city before attackers rushed a medical training centre for midwives. A gun battle that lasted for nearly six hours ensued, in which two people were killed.

On Monday, Nangarhar provincial health officials said that in the past three months at least 160 people have been killed and more than 490 wounded in attacks on the province.

Separately, a roadside bomb hit a Kabul-bound passenger bus in western Afghanistan on Tuesday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 37 others, including many women and children, officials said.

""The attack took place very early this morning, the bus with dozens of people on board drove over a roadside bomb,"" Bellis said.

""The government is blaming the attack on the Taliban,"" she added.

The wounded are being treated in a hospital in Herat province.

There was no immediate confirmation that the Taliban was responsible for the blast.



The explosion took place as the bus travelled through Bala Baluk district of Farah at 4:30am (00:00 GMT), provincial governor spokesman Naser Mehri told AFP.

Photos posted on social media - purportedly of the bus - showed the vehicle's blackened shell and dozens of men standing at the scene.



The Taliban has a heavy presence in Farah. It launched a major attempt to take over the provincial capital in May, triggering intense fighting with US and Afghan forces. 



After a day-long battle, Taliban fighters were forced to the outskirts of the city.

Civilians have borne the brunt of the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan. Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), such as remotely detonated or pressure-plate bombs, are one of the main causes of casualties.



Such IEDs caused 877 civilian casualties in the first half of 2018 - 232 deaths and 645 injuries - accounting for 17 percent of overall casualties.",0.0

2018-07-31,The Denver Post,A fair thats one for the books Booksellers and bibliophiles converge on Denver this weekend,"Its a fair bet to say that most Coloradans have never been to a book fair. Maybe thats because they think book fairs are those deals that schools set up that offer books kids would read, or maybe because they think book fairs are for people who walk around in tweed sport coats with leather elbow patches and sneer at you as if you had just eaten your salad with a soup spoon.

Neither stereotype is true, and this weekend will be an excellent opportunity for you to see why.

For two days at the Rocky Mountain Book and Paper Fair, bibliophiles of all stripes will be able to see tens of thousands of books with a variety of subject matter and prices that theyll never be able to see online or even in the biggest book stores.

Fair organizer Carol Mobley of the sponsoring Rocky Mountain Antiquarian Booksellers Association said the event has attracted 80 booksellers from throughout the United States, all of whom hope to show you something you wont be able to resist, whether its a Civil War history for $10 or signed copies of Isaac Asimovs Foundation Trilogy for $17,500.

The concept of the book fair is as old as it is simple. Since the debut of the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany some 500 years ago, organizers have invited booksellers to set up booths and offer a sampling of their wares. In the U.S., bibliophiles point to the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of Americas New York fair as having unusual and rare material that doesnt come to the market that often, according to ABBA executive director Susan Benne. Revenue runs well into the millions, she said.

The Colorado fair is more down to earth. As the largest fair in the Rocky Mountain West, its a chance for booksellers to show off (and sell off) whatever it is that they specialize in: literature, history, art, mysteries, childrens books, leather-bound books, or things from neighboring fields, such as postcards, pamphlets, pictures and posters. But as with any commercial enterprise, what allows book fairs to exist is the interest of readers and collectors.

Book fairs appeal to book-lovers for several reasons. Richard Oates, owner of Blind Horse Books in Key Largo, said one advantage of book fairs in todays digital world is that you actually can handle the books, and you get what you see. Also, if you have a genre interest  say, Nordic noir  you may be able to find a dealer who specializes in that, or who knows one who does, Oates added.

Kansas City-based bookseller Annette Hancks said, We see a lot of book fair attendees who are looking for a book or books from their childhood that they remember fondly and regret no longer having. People come through looking for local history and western American history or a novel that they always wanted to read, or a favorite author.

If their interests include science fiction or illustration or mysteries or cookbooks or maps or postcards or just interesting and unusual items, then there will probably be something at a book fair to interest them. And for many of us, the $10 find can be just as exciting as the one for $10,000.

Booksellers and bibliophiles alike agree that its best to do your homework and have a strategy for attending a book fair, particularly if youre more a collector than casual reader. Most book fairs have listings of dealers and their specialties available in advance of a fair, enabling an attendee to prioritize what booths to visit first.

California bookseller John Howell recommends that you read the fair program in advance and map out your attack. Find the dealers who have the material that might interest you and systematically work through your list. The best times to go? Selection is always best at the beginning, but bargains are sometimes found at the end.

Also, introduce yourself to dealers who have the kind of books you want, and let them know of your interests. (Many will keep track of your information and contact you when they find something that may interest you.)

Collector Jeff Johnson encourages attendees to take their time and not be afraid to ask questions.

Theres always something to learn, and most dealers like to teach. There will be some grumpy ones  it seems to go with the territory but most of the fairs seem to have booksellers younger, most personable staff to interact with customers.

Bookseller Oates suggests that you budget one hour of browsing for every 10 booths, then another hour to return where you may wish to purchase.

Take notes, he advises. It is amazing how you can become lost and not find that booth where you saw the perfect book as a gift.

Gail Sanftleben of Read Em Again Books in Virginia encourages visitors to walk the aisles in one direction and then again in the opposite direction. Different things will pop out at you each way, she said.

As for the booksellers themselves, few grew up wanting to be booksellers. Steve Eisenstein, host of a show on radio called Rare Book Cafe, said that booksellers are either drawn to the field or fall into it. An exception is Rob Roulon-Miller, a second-generation bookseller who teaches at the Colorado Antiquarian Book School in Colorado Springs  one of the few formal venues to learn about books.

Most booksellers start out innocently enough as readers, then morph into collectors. At some point they start protecting their books dust jackets with acetate covers (book-sellings gateway drug, if there ever was one). And when their collections outgrow their bookcases, they become booksellers.

The ABAAs Benne said her membership includes former academics, librarians, physicians, attorneys and consultants. (Hancks was once a championship typist.) One of Roulon-Millers students this year has a law degree from Harvard and is working on her Ph.D. in philosophy at NYU. She wants to see if the world of rare book-selling might be right for me.

Forego a career as a lawyer or academic to pursue book-selling? The appeal of books speaks volumes.
